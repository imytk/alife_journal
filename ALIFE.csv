A truly comparative biology is needed to extend these concepts. Because we cannot observe life on other planets, we are left with the alternative of creating Artificial Life forms on earth. I will discuss the approach of inoculating evolution by natural selection into the medium of the digital computer. This is not a physical/chemical medium; it is a logical/informational medium. Thus, these new instances of evolution are not subject to the same physical laws as organic evolution (e.g., the laws of thermodynamics) and exist in what amounts to another universe, governed by the “physical laws” of the logic of the computer. This exercise gives us a broader perspective on what evolution is and what it does.             An evolutionary approach to synthetic biology consists of inoculating the process of evolution by natural selection into an artificial medium. Evolution is then allowed to find the natural forms of living organisms in the artificial medium. These are not models of life, but independent instances of life. This essay is intended to communicate a way of thinking about synthetic biology that leads to a particular approach: to understand and respect the natural form of the artificial medium, to facilitate the process of evolution in generating forms that are adapted to the medium, and to let evolution find forms and processes that naturally exploit the possibilities inherent in the medium. Examples are cited of synthetic biology embedded in the computational medium, where in addition to being an exercise in experimental comparative evolutionary biology, it is also a possible means of harnessing the evolutionary process for the production of complex computer software.","1993-10","2021-08-06 07:19:09","2021-08-06 07:19:09","2021-08-06 07:19:09","179-209","","1_2","1","","Artificial Life","An Evolutionary Approach to Synthetic Biology","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As an origin of diversity, dynamic clustering of identical chaotic elements, globally coupled each to the other, is briefly reviewed. The clustering is extended to nonlinear dynamics on hypercubic lattices, which enables us to construct a self-organizing genetic algorithm. A mechanism of maintenance of diversity, “homeochaos,” is given in an ecological system with interaction among many species. Homeochaos provides a dynamic stability sustained by high-dimensional weak chaos. A novel mechanism of cell differentiation is presented, based on dynamic clustering. Here, a new concept—“open chaos”—is proposed for the instability in a dynamical system with growing degrees of freedom. It is suggested that studies based on interacting chaotic elements can replace both top-down and bottom-up approaches.","1993-10","2021-08-06 07:19:03","2021-08-06 07:19:03","2021-08-06 07:19:03","163-177","","1_2","1","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\6CBJ9HM4\Kaneko - 1993 - Chaos as a Source of Complexity and Diversity in E.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The continuity between genotype and phenotype interferes with the process of evolution on multipeaked adaptive landscapes because the progeny of genotypes that lie on separate adaptive peaks fall into valleys of low fitness. This problem can be solved by epistasis, which disrupts the continuity between genotype and phenotype. In a five-locus sexual haploid model with maximum epistasis, natural selection in multipeak landscapes evolves a set of genotypes that a) occupy the adaptive peaks and b) give rise to each other by recombination. The epistatic genetic system therefore “molds” the phenotypic distribution to the adaptive landscape, without assortative mating or linkage disequilibrium. If the adaptive landscape is changed, a new set of genotypes quickly evolves that satisfies conditions a and b, above, for the new peaks.             Our model may be relevant to a number of recalcitrant problems in biology and also stands in contrast to Kauffman's [3] NK model of evolution on rugged fitness surfaces, in which epistasis and recombination tend to constrain the evolutionary process.","1994-10","2021-08-06 07:17:27","2021-08-06 07:17:27","2021-08-06 07:17:27","117-128","","1","2","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These include: (a) how populations of organisms traverse their adaptive landscapes; (b) what the relation between adaptedness and fitness is; and (c) the formation of multicellular organisms from basic units or cells. In this article we study these issues using a model that is both general and simple. The system, derived from the CA (cellular automata) model, consists of a two-dimensional grid of interacting organisms that may evolve over time. We first present designed multicellular organisms that display several interesting behaviors, including reproduction, growth, and mobility. We then turn our attention to evolution in various environments, including an environment in which competition for space occurs, an IPD (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma) environment, an environment of spatial niches, and an environment of temporal niches. One of the advantages of artificial life (AL) models is the opportunities they offer in performing in-depth studies of the evolutionary process. This is accomplished in our case by observing not only phenotypic effects but also such measures as fitness, operability, energy and the genescape.

Horn's classical model predicts that colonial birds are more successful than territorial ones in a patchy resource environment, and the reverse is true when resources are evenly distributed. The weak point of the model is confusion between colony formation and flock foraging and implicit assumption of perfect knowledge of resource distribution by foraging birds. The authors made an alife model that realized both flock foraging and colonial formation simultaneously during evolution in a patchy environment. The reference organisms were egrets, which make colonial nests in the breeding season and colonial roosts in the nonbreeding season. In the computer model, artificial egrets used the presence of other egrets as an indicator to locate resource-rich patches in a resource-clumped environment. On the contrary, egrets were less reliant on other individuals as a source of foraging information in evenly distributed resource conditions. Colonial nesting was also induced only in a patchy environment where the foraging efficiency was always higher than the evenly distributed condition. Local enhancement played an important role in achieving colonial and flock foraging.","1994-07","2021-08-06 07:16:15","2021-08-06 07:16:15","2021-08-06 07:16:15","391-411","","4","1","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The agent has (a) a three-dimensional body with internal muscle actuators and functional fins that deforms and locomotes in accordance with biomechanic and hydrodynamic principles; (b) sensors, including eyes that can image the environment; and (c) a brain with motor, perception, behavior, and learning centers. Artificial fishes exhibit a repertoire of piscatorial behaviors that rely on their perceptual awareness of their dynamic habitat. Individual and emergent collective behaviors include caudal and pectoral locomotion, collision avoidance, foraging, preying, schooling, and mating. Furthermore, artificial fishes can learn how to locomote through practice and sensory reinforcement.

In this study, we investigate how SPTD is generated without task-specific behavioral features or other forms of a priori knowledge and detect how methods of generating SPTD can be transferred from the domain of AE to ER. A promising finding is that in both types of systems, in systems from ER that generate behavioral diversity and also in the investigated speciation model, selective pressure is generated towards unpopulated regions of search space. In a simple case study we investigate the practical implications of these findings and point to options for transferring the idea of self-organizing SPTD in AEs to the domain of ER.","2015-11","2021-08-04 13:00:31","2021-08-04 13:00:31","2021-08-04 13:00:31","464-480","","4","21","","Artificial Life","Lessons from Speciation Dynamics","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\ZAQSYPCY\Hamann - 2015 - Lessons from Speciation Dynamics How to Generate .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Synthetic cells are currently used as primitive cell models and are very promising tools for future biotechnology. Despite the recent experimental advancements and sophistication reached in this field, the complete elucidation of many fundamental physical aspects still poses experimental and theoretical challenges. The interplay between solute capture and vesicle formation is one of the most intriguing ones. In a series of studies, we have reported that when vesicles spontaneously form in a dilute solution of proteins, ribosomes, or ribo-peptidic complexes, then, contrary to statistical predictions, it is possible to find a small fraction of liposomes (<1%) that contain a very large number of solutes, so that their local (intravesicular) concentrations largely exceed the expected value. More recently, we have demonstrated that this effect (spontaneous crowding) operates also on multimolecular mixtures, and can drive the synthesis of proteins inside vesicles, whereas the same reaction does not proceed at a measurable rate in the external bulk phase. Here we firstly introduce and discuss these already published observations. Then, we present a computational investigation of the encapsulation of transcription-translation (TX-TL) machinery inside vesicles, based on a minimal protein synthesis model and on different solute partition functions. Results show that experimental data are compatible with an entrapment model that follows a power law rather than a Gaussian distribution. The results are discussed from the viewpoint of origin of life, highlighting open questions and possible future research directions.","2015-11","2021-08-04 13:00:23","2021-08-04 13:00:23","2021-08-04 13:00:23","445-463","","4","21","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In effect the novel platform, which is inspired by the Sodarace construction set, makes it easy to set up creative scenarios that test the abilities of Sodarace-like creatures made of masses and springs. In this way it allows the researcher to focus on evolutionary algorithms and dynamics. The new indirectly encoded Sodarace (IESoR) system introduced in this article extends the original Sodarace by enabling the evolution of significantly more complex and regular creature morphologies. These morphologies are themselves encoded by compositional pattern-producing networks (CPPNs), an indirect encoding previously shown effective at encoding regularities and symmetries in structure. The capability of this lightweight system to facilitate research in artificial life is then demonstrated through both walking and jumping domains, in which IESoR discovers a wide breadth of strategies through novelty search with local competition.","2015-11","2021-08-04 13:00:16","2021-08-04 13:00:16","2021-08-04 13:00:16","432-444","","4","21","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The variables belonging to a relevant subset should have a strong integration with the other variables of the same relevant subset, and a much weaker interaction with the other system variables. On this basis, extending previous work on neural networks, an information-theoretic measure, the dynamical cluster index, is introduced in order to identify good candidate relevant subsets. The method does not require any previous knowledge of the relationships among the system variables, but relies on observations of their values over time. We show its usefulness in several application domains, including: (i) random Boolean networks, where the whole network is made of different subnetworks with different topological relationships (independent or interacting subnetworks); (ii) leader-follower dynamics, subject to noise and fluctuations; (iii) catalytic reaction networks in a flow reactor; (iv) the MAPK signaling pathway in eukaryotes. The validity of the method has been tested in cases where the data are generated by a known dynamical model and the dynamical cluster index is applied in order to uncover significant aspects of its organization; however, it is important that it can also be applied to time series coming from field data without any reference to a model. Given that it is based on relative frequencies of sets of values, the method could be applied also to cases where the data are not ordered in time. Several indications to improve the scope and effectiveness of the dynamical cluster index to analyze the organization of complex systems are finally given.","2015-11","2021-08-04 13:00:07","2021-08-04 13:00:07","2021-08-04 13:00:07","412-431","","4","21","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\S57PX2VL\Villani et al. - 2015 - The Search for Candidate Relevant Subsets of Varia.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During this baking process, the heat applied on the entire sheet induces contraction of the contracting layer and thus forms an instructed bend in the sheet. To attain the targeted folding angles, the V-fold spans method is used. The targeted angle θ               out               can be kinematically encoded into crease geometry.

We redefined collective human decision making and creativity as evolution of ecologies of ideas, where populations of ideas evolve via continual applications of evolutionary operators such as reproduction, recombination, mutation, selection, and migration of ideas, each conducted by participating humans. Based on this evolutionary perspective, we generated hypotheses about collective human decision making, using agent-based computer simulations. The hypotheses were then tested through several experiments with real human subjects. Throughout this project, we utilized evolutionary computation (EC) in non-traditional ways—(1) as a theoretical framework for reinterpreting the dynamics of idea generation and selection, (2) as a computational simulation model of collective human decision-making processes, and (3) as a research tool for collecting high-resolution experimental data on actual collaborative design and decision making from human subjects.

Through a discussion of artificial life computer simulations, ideas of agency are problematized, and artificial life's single purposeful actor, the agent, is replaced by agential, an adjective denoting a relationship rather than a subject-object duality. We then seek to reinterpret the difficult-to-define term “emergence.” Agency in artificial life emerges through what Barad calls entanglement, in this case between observers and their apparatus, a perpetual engagement between observations of a system and their interpretations.

However, even the direct engineering of the simplest genetic elements (switches, logic gates) is a challenge and involves intense lab work. As the complexity of biological circuits grows, it becomes more complicated and less fruitful to rely on the rational design paradigm, because it demands many time-consuming trial-and-error cycles. One of the reasons is the context-dependent behavior of small assembly parts (like BioBricks), which in a complex environment often interact in an unpredictable way. Therefore, the idea of evolutionary engineering (artificial directed in vivo evolution) based on screening and selection of randomized combinatorial genetic circuit libraries became popular. In this article we build on the so-called dual selection technique. We propose a plasmid-based framework using toxin-antitoxin pairs together with the relaxase conjugative protein, enabling an efficient autonomous in vivo evolutionary selection of simple Boolean circuits in bacteria (E. coli was chosen for demonstration). Unlike previously reported protocols, both on and off selection steps can run simultaneously in various cells in the same environment without human intervention; and good circuits not only survive the selection process but are also horizontally transferred by conjugation to the neighbor cells to accelerate the convergence rate of the selection process. Our directed evolution strategy combines a new dual selection method with fluorescence-based screening to increase the robustness of the technique against mutations. As there are more orthogonal toxin-antitoxin pairs in E. coli, the approach is likely to be scalable to more complex functions. In silico experiments based on empirical data confirm the high search and selection capability of the protocol.","2015-05","2021-08-04 12:55:48","2021-08-04 12:55:48","2021-08-04 12:55:48","247-260","","2","21","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined artificial interaction between two isolated dishes containing Euglena cells, which are photophobic to strong blue light. The spatial distribution of swimming Euglena cells in two micro-aquariums in the dishes was evaluated as a set of new measures: the trace momentums (TMs). The blue light patterns next irradiated onto each dish were deduced from the set of TMs using digital or analogue feedback algorithms. In the digital feedback experiment, one of two different pattern-formation rules was imposed on each feedback system. The resultant cell distribution patterns satisfied the two rules with an and operation, showing that cooperative interaction was realized in the interlink feedback. In the analogue experiment, two dishes A and B were interlinked by a feedback algorithm that illuminated dish A (B) with blue light of intensity proportional to the cell distribution in dish B (A). In this case, a distribution pattern and its reverse were autonomously formed in the two dishes. The autonomous formation of a pair of reversal patterns reflects a type of habitat separation realized by competitive interaction through the interlink feedback. According to this study, interlink feedback between two or more separate culture dishes enables artificial interactions between isolated microbial groups, and autonomous cellular distribution patterns will be achieved by correlating various microbial species, despite environmental and spatial scale incompatibilities. The optical interlink feedback is also useful for enhancing the performance of Euglena-based soft biocomputing.","2015-05","2021-08-04 12:55:41","2021-08-04 12:55:41","2021-08-04 12:55:41","234-246","","2","21","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For excitable systems, which can be brought into oscillation by an external stimulus, the excitation threshold is a crucial parameter. This is evident for neurons, which only generate an action potential when exposed to a sufficiently high concentration of excitatory neurotransmitters, which may only be achieved when multiple presynaptic axons deliver their action potential simultaneously to the synaptic cleft. Dynamic systems composed of relatively simple chemicals are of interest because they can serve as a model for physiological processes or can be exploited to implement chemical computing. With these applications in mind, we have studied the properties of the oscillatory Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction in 3D-printed reaction vessels with open channels of different dimensions. It is demonstrated that the channel geometry can be used to modulate the excitability of the BZ medium, switching a continuously oscillating medium to an excitable medium. Because large networks of channel-connected reaction wells of different depth can easily be fabricated by 3D printing, local excitability modulation could be built into the structure of the reaction vessel itself, opening the way to more extensive experimentation with networks of chemical oscillators.","2015-05","2021-08-04 12:55:35","2021-08-04 12:55:35","2021-08-04 12:55:35","225-233","","2","21","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inspired by the versatility of nature's architecture, we investigate aggregates of membrane-enclosed droplets as a design concept for robotics. This will require droplets capable of sensing, information processing, and actuation. It will also require the integration of functionally specialized droplets into an interconnected functional unit. Based on results from the literature and from our own laboratory, we argue the viability of this approach. Sensing and information processing in droplets have been the subject of several recent studies, on which we draw. Integrating droplets into coherently acting units and the aspect of controlled actuation for locomotion have received less attention.

We model social learning in artificial agents with real robots. The robots are able to observe and learn each others' movement patterns using their on-board sensors only, so that imitation is embodied. We show that the variations that arise from embodiment allow certain behaviors that are better adapted to the process of imitation to emerge and evolve during multiple cycles of imitation. As these behaviors are more robust to uncertainties in the real robots' sensors and actuators, they can be learned by other members of the collective with higher fidelity. Three different types of learned-behavior memory have been experimentally tested to investigate the effect of memory capacity on the evolution of movement patterns, and results show that as the movement patterns evolve through multiple cycles of imitation, selection, and variation, the robots are able to, in a sense, agree on the structure of the behaviors that are imitated.","2015-05","2021-08-04 12:55:09","2021-08-04 12:55:09","2021-08-04 12:55:09","141-165","","2","21","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\ZKWSUBNQ\Erbas et al. - 2015 - On the Evolution of Behaviors through Embodied Imi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, soft robots can be difficult to control with standard control methods. Fortunately, evolutionary algorithms can offer an elegant solution to this problem. Instead of creating controls to handle the intricate dynamics of these robots, we can simply evolve the controls using a simulation to provide an evaluation function. In this article, we show how such a control paradigm can be applied to an emerging field within soft robotics: robots based on tensegrity structures. We take the model of the Spherical Underactuated Planetary Exploration Robot ball (SUPERball), an icosahedron tensegrity robot under production at NASA Ames Research Center, develop a rolling locomotion algorithm, and study the learned behavior using an accurate model of the SUPERball simulated in the NASA Tensegrity Robotics Toolkit. We first present the historical-average fitness-shaping algorithm for coevolutionary algorithms to speed up learning while favoring robustness over optimality. Second, we use a distributed control approach by coevolving open-loop control signals for each controller. Being simple and distributed, open-loop controllers can be readily implemented on SUPERball hardware without the need for sensor information or precise coordination. We analyze signals of different complexities and frequencies. Among the learned policies, we take one of the best and use it to analyze different aspects of the rolling gait, such as lengths, tensions, and energy consumption. We also discuss the correlation between the signals controlling different parts of the tensegrity robot.","2015-05","2021-08-04 12:55:02","2021-08-04 12:55:02","2021-08-04 12:55:02","119-140","","2","21","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The electrical responses to stimuli may propagate along protoplasmic tubes for distances exceeding tens of centimeters, as impulses in neural pathways do. A slime mold makes decisions about its propagation direction based on information fusion from thousands of spatially extended protoplasmic loci, similarly to a neuron collecting information from its dendritic tree. The analogy is distant yet inspiring. We speculate on whether alternative—would-be—nervous systems can be developed and practically implemented from the slime mold. We uncover analogies between the slime mold and neurons, and demonstrate that the slime mold can play the roles of primitive mechanoreceptors, photoreceptors, and chemoreceptors; we also show how the Physarum neural pathways develop. The results constituted the first step towards experimental laboratory studies of nervous system implementation in slime molds.","2015-02","2021-08-04 12:54:08","2021-08-04 12:54:08","2021-08-04 12:54:08","73-91","","1","21","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The significance of this region was first emphasized in cellular automata models when a single simple measure, λ               CA               , identified it as a transitional region between order and chaos. Here we introduce a parameter λ               NN               that is inspired by λ               CA               but is defined for recurrent neural networks. We show through a series of systematic computational experiments that λ               NN               generally orders the dynamical behaviors of randomly connected/weighted recurrent neural networks in the same way that λ               CA               does for cellular automata. By extending this ordering to larger values of λ               NN               than has typically been done with λ               CA               and cellular automata, we find that a second edge-of-chaos region exists on the opposite side of the chaotic region. These basic results are found to hold under different assumptions about network connectivity, but vary substantially in their details. The results show that the basic concept underlying the lambda parameter can usefully be extended to other types of complex dynamical systems than just cellular automata.","2015-02","2021-08-04 12:54:01","2021-08-04 12:54:01","2021-08-04 12:54:01","55-71","","1","21","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While many such general principles have been hypothesized, conclusively testing them is difficult because life on Earth provides only a singular example from which to infer. To circumvent this limitation, this article formalizes an approach called radical reimplementation. The idea is to investigate an abstract biological hypothesis by intentionally reimplementing its main principles to diverge maximally from existing natural examples. If the reimplementation successfully exhibits properties resembling biology, it may support the underlying hypothesis better than an alternative example inspired more directly by nature. The approach thereby provides a principled alternative to a common tradition of defending and minimizing deviations from nature in artificial life. This work reviews examples that can be interpreted through the lens of radical reimplementation to yield potential insights into biology despite having purposely unnatural experimental setups. In this way, radical reimplementation can help renew the relevance of computational systems for investigating biological theory and can act as a practical philosophical tool to help separate the fundamental features of terrestrial biology from the epiphenomenal.","2015-02","2021-08-04 12:53:47","2021-08-04 12:53:47","2021-08-04 12:53:47","21-46","","1","21","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\VDZAC5QE\Lehman and Stanley - 2015 - Investigating Biological Assumptions through Radic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The challenges of the underlying physics force the introduction of closed-loop controllers for both spatial patterning and geometric structure. Reliable development is achieved not through elaborate control procedures or exact solutions, but through crude layering of independent, overlapping mechanisms. As a consequence, development and regeneration together become one process, morphological homeostasis, which, owing to its internal feedbacks and partially redundant architecture, is remarkably robust to both knockout damage and environmental variation. The incomplete nature of such redundancy furnishes an evolutionary rationale for its preservation, in spite of individual knockout experiments that may suggest it has little purpose.","2016-11","2021-08-04 12:53:12","2021-08-04 12:53:12","2021-08-04 12:53:12","518-536","","4","22","","Artificial Life","Partial Redundancy and Morphological Homeostasis","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\J32ECEK3\Brodsky - 2016 - Partial Redundancy and Morphological Homeostasis .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As such individuals interact with an environment, they undergo sequences of structural changes that correspond to their ontogenies. Ultimately, individuals that adapt to their environment, and increase their chances of survival, persist. This article provides an initial step towards a more formal treatment of these concepts. A network of possible ontogenies is uncovered by subjecting a model protocell to sequential perturbations and mapping the resulting structural configurations. The analysis of this network reveals trends in how the protocell can move between configurations, how its morphology changes, and how the role of the environment varies throughout. Viability is defined as expected life span given an initial configuration. This leads to two notions of adaptivity: a local adaptivity that addresses how viability changes in plastic transitions, and a global adaptivity that looks at longer-term tendencies for increased viability. To demonstrate how different protocell-environment pairings produce different patterns of ontogenic change, we generate and analyze a second ontogenic network for the same protocell in a different environment. Finally, the mechanisms of a minimal adaptive transition are analyzed, and it is shown that these rely on distributed spatial processes rather than an explicit regulatory mechanism. The combination of this model and analytical techniques provides a foundation for studying the emergence of viability, ontogeny, and adaptivity in more biologically realistic systems.","2016-11","2021-08-04 12:53:05","2021-08-04 12:53:05","2021-08-04 12:53:05","499-517","","4","22","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Only one example of life exists—one that proceeded from a single self-replicating organism (or a set of replicating hypercycles) to the vast complexity we see today in Earth's biosphere. We know that emergent life has the potential to evolve great increases in complexity, but it is unknown if evolvability is automatic given any self-replicating organism. At the same time, it is difficult to test such questions in biochemical systems. Laboratory studies with RNA replicators have had some success with exploring the capacities of simple self-replicators, but these experiments are still limited in both capabilities and scope. Here, we use the digital evolution system Avida to explore the interplay between emergent replicators (rare randomly assembled self-replicators) and evolvability. We find that we can classify fixed-length emergent replicators in Avida into two classes based on functional analysis. One class is more evolvable in the sense of optimizing the replicators' replication abilities. However, the other class is more evolvable in the sense of acquiring evolutionary innovations. We tie this tradeoff in evolvability to the structure of the respective classes' replication machinery, and speculate on the relevance of these results to biochemical replicators.","2016-11","2021-08-04 12:52:59","2021-08-04 12:52:59","2021-08-04 12:52:59","483-498","","4","22","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\NZMVFYAQ\LaBar et al. - 2016 - Evolvability Tradeoffs in Emergent Digital Replica.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Actors in OOCC are embedded in space and subject to diffusion; since they are neither created nor destroyed, their mass is conserved. Actors use programs constructed from combinators to asynchronously update their own states and the states of other actors in their neighborhoods. The fact that programs and combinators are themselves reified as actors makes it possible to build programs that build programs from combinators of a few primitive types using asynchronous spatial processes that resemble chemistry as much as computation. To demonstrate this, OOCC is used to define a parallel, asynchronous, spatially distributed self-replicating system modeled in part on the living cell. Since interactions among its parts result in the construction of more of these same parts, the system is strongly constructive.

By contrast, living systems, viewed as computations, naturally tolerate fallible hardware by repairing and rebuilding structures even while in use—and suggest ways to compute using massive amounts of unreliable, merely best-effort hardware. However, we currently know little about programming without deterministic execution, in architectures where traditional models of computation—and deterministic ALife models such as the Game of Life—need not apply. This expanded article presents ulam, a language designed to balance concurrency and programmability upon best-effort hardware, using lifelike strategies to achieve robust and scalable computations. The article reviews challenges for traditional architecture, introduces the active-media computational model for which ulam is designed, and then presents the language itself, touching on its nomenclature and surface appearance as well as some broader aspects of robust software engineering.

One might view those signals as a very rudimentary genetic code, since they guide the formation of the “child” from its “parent.” In principle, the signals could mutate to deliver a child better suited to reproduction in this artificial world. But even the simplest signal-based replicator discovered so far requires 58 specific CA transition rules that have been carefully hand-crafted to exactly meet the requirement of self-replication. Could such a system emerge without human design? This article considers how that might occur. Specifically, it demonstrates that the application of two heuristics can increase the probability that self-replication will emerge when needed transition rules are completed at random.

This is largely due to the Red Queen effect that dictates heterospecific fitness interdependence. In simulation studies of coevolving systems, master tournaments are often used to obtain more informed fitness measures by testing evolved individuals against past and future opponents. However, such tournaments still contain certain ambiguities. We introduce the use of a phenotypic cluster analysis to examine the distribution of opponent categories throughout an evolutionary sequence. This analysis, adopted from widespread usage in the bioinformatics community, can be applied to master tournament data. This allows us to construct behavior-based category trees, obtaining a hierarchical classification of phenotypes that are suspected to interleave during cyclic evolution. We use the cluster data to establish the existence of switching-genes that control opponent specialization, suggesting the retention of dormant genetic adaptations, that is, genetic memory. Our overarching goal is to reiterate how computer simulations may have importance to the broader understanding of evolutionary dynamics in general. We emphasize a further shift from a component-driven to an interaction-driven perspective in understanding coevolving systems. As yet, it is unclear how the sudden development of switching-genes relates to the gradual emergence of genetic adaptability. Likely, context genes gradually provide the appropriate genetic environment wherein the switching-gene effect can be exploited.","2016-08","2021-08-04 12:51:29","2021-08-04 12:51:29","2021-08-04 12:51:29","319-352","","3","22","","Artificial Life","Cyclic Incrementality in Competitive Coevolution","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\8W2PFCZ3\Janssen et al. - 2016 - Cyclic Incrementality in Competitive Coevolution .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The morphologies and behaviors of virtual prey creatures are evolved using a genetic algorithm based on the predation interactions between predators and prey. Both population sizes are also changed, depending on the fitness. We observe two types of cyclic behaviors, corresponding to short-term and long-term dynamics. The former can be interpreted as a simple population dynamics of Lotka–Volterra type. It is shown that the latter cycle is based on the interaction between the changes in the prey strategy against predators and the long-term change in both population sizes, resulting partly from a tradeoff between their defensive success and the cost of defense.","2016-05","2021-08-04 12:50:42","2021-08-04 12:50:42","2021-08-04 12:50:42","226-240","","2","22","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I reject that claim by construction, introducing a formal method to empirically test whether a trait is an adaptation. The method presented is general, intuitive, and effective at identifying adaptations while remaining agnostic about their adaptive function. The test follows directly from the notion that adaptations arise from variation, heritability, and differential fitness in an evolving population: I operationalize these three concepts at the trait level, formally defining measures of individual traits. To test whether a trait is an adaptation, these measures are evaluated, locating the trait within a three-dimensional parameterized trait space. Within this space, I identify a region containing all adaptations; a trait's position relative to this adaptive region of trait space describes its status as an adaptation. The test can be applied in any evolving system where a few domain-specific statistical measures can be constructed; I demonstrate the construction of these measures, most notably a measure of an individual's hypothetical fitness if it were born with a different trait, in Packard's Bugs ALife model. The test is applied in Bugs, and shown to conform with our intuitive classification of adaptations.","2016-05","2021-08-04 12:50:35","2021-08-04 12:50:35","2021-08-04 12:50:35","211-225","","2","22","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this assumes that it knows which other agents it observes, and thus which code they use. In our model, however, we wish to preclude that: It is not clear which other agents an agent is observing, and the resulting usable information is therefore influenced by the universality of the code used and by which agents an agent is listening to.

This cell-free TX-TL system is encapsulated into cell-sized unilamellar liposomes to express synthetic DNA programs. In this work, we study the compartmentalization of cell-free TX-TL reactions, one of the aspects of minimal cell module integration. We analyze the signals of various liposome populations by fluorescence microscopy for one and for two reporter genes, and for an inducible genetic circuit. We show that small nutrient molecules and proteins are encapsulated uniformly in the liposomes with small fluctuations. However, cell-free expression displays large fluctuations in signals among the same population, which are due to heterogeneous encapsulation of the DNA template. Consequently, the correlations of gene expression with the compartment dimension are difficult to predict accurately.

Combining robustness and plasticity provides a measure of viability as the average expected survival time under ongoing perturbation, and allows us to measure how viability is affected as the configuration undergoes transitions.

We demonstrate this with a very simple but thermodynamically reasonable artificial chemistry model. By suppressing the direct reaction from reactants to products, we obtain the simplest kind of autocatalytic cycle, resulting in exponential growth. When these simple first-order cycles are prevented from forming, the system achieves superexponential growth through more complex, higher-order autocatalytic cycles. This leads to nonlinear phenomena such as oscillations and bistability, the latter of which is of particular interest regarding the origins of life.","2016-05","2021-08-04 12:50:02","2021-08-04 12:50:02","2021-08-04 12:50:02","138-152","","2","22","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results show that features of early childhood cognition dominate the understanding of the term life even in adulthood. Textbook knowledge and definitions derived from specific knowledge systems and beliefs are of minor importance. For an ethical differentiation between life forms the ability to feel and to suffer is seen as the crucial criterion. We conclude that lay perspectives on the concept of life can shape a normative discourse on existing as well as on new life forms in a crucial way. In addition, these perspectives may also strongly influence the expectations towards the life-as-it-could-be that is brought forward by the artificial life community. While some concepts like metabolism exist both in scientific and in everyday reasoning as criteria for life, the normative discussion on life is dominated by such ideas as a hierarchical order of living kinds, which emphasize “easy to think” concepts of a moral differentiation. These can also form a basis for the moral standing of artificial life.","2016-02","2021-08-04 12:49:14","2021-08-04 12:49:14","2021-08-04 12:49:14","119-133","","1","22","","Artificial Life","What is Life—in Everyday Understanding?","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, indirect developmental mappings are often a necessity. Varying the amount of genotype information changes the cardinality of the mapping, which in turn affects the developmental process. An open question is how to find the genotype size and representation in which a developmental solution would fit. A restricted pool of genes may not be large enough to encode a solution or may need complex heuristics to find a realistic size. On the other hand, using the whole set of possible regulatory combinations may be intractable. In nature, the genomes of biological organisms are not fixed in size; they slowly evolve and acquire new genes by random gene duplications. Such incremental growth of genome information can be beneficial also in the artificial domain. For an evolutionary and developmental (evo-devo) system based on cellular automata, we investigate an incremental evolutionary growth of genomes without any a priori knowledge on the necessary genotype size. Evolution starts with simple solutions in a low-dimensional space and incrementally increases the genotype complexity by means of gene duplication, allowing the evolution of scalable genomes that are able to adapt genetic information content while compactness and efficiency are retained. The results are consistent when the target phenotypic complexity, the geometry size, and the number of cell states are scaled up.","2016-02","2021-08-04 12:49:00","2021-08-04 12:49:00","2021-08-04 12:49:00","76-111","","1","22","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous work has claimed that the evolutionary fixation of social learning requires decision-making cognitive abilities that result in transmission bias (e.g., discriminatory imitation) and/or guided variation (e.g., adaptive modification of behaviors through individual learning). Here, we present and analyze a simple agent-based model that demonstrates that the transition from instinctive actuators (i.e., non-learning agents whose behavior is hardcoded in their genes) to social learners (i.e., agents that imitate behaviors) can occur without invoking such decision-making abilities. The model shows that the social learning of a trait may evolve and fix in a population if there are many possible behavioral variants of the trait, if it is subject to strong selection pressure for survival (as distinct from reproduction), and if imitation errors occur at a higher rate than genetic mutation. These results demonstrate that the (sometimes implicit) assumption in prior work that decision-making abilities are required is incorrect, thus allowing a more parsimonious explanation for the evolution of social learning that applies to a wider range of organisms. Furthermore, we identify genotype-phenotype disengagement as a signal for the imminent fixation of social learners, and explain the way in which this disengagement leads to the emergence of a basic form of cultural evolution (i.e., a non-genetic evolutionary system).","2017-11","2021-08-04 12:47:32","2021-08-04 12:47:32","2021-08-04 12:47:32","493-517","","4","23","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\46MQKL94\Gonzalez et al. - 2017 - Minimally Sufficient Conditions for the Evolution .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, alternative scenarios not requiring any chemical oscillation have also been proposed. Each of the various protocell models proposed to support one or another scenario comes with its own set of specific assumptions, which makes it difficult to ascertain whether chemical oscillations are required or not for cellular self-replication. This article compares these two cases within a single whole-cell model framework. This model relies upon a membrane embedding a chemical reaction network (CRN) synthesizing all the cellular constituents, including the membrane, by feeding from an external nutrient. Assuming the osmolarity is kept constant, the system dynamics are governed by a set of nonlinear differential equations coupling the chemical concentrations and the surface-area-to-volume ratio. The resulting asymptotic trajectories are used to determine the cellular shape by minimizing the membrane bending energy (within an approximate predefined family of shapes). While the stationary case can be handled quite generally, the oscillatory one is investigated using a simple oscillating CRN example, which is used to identify features that are expected to hold for any network. It is found that cellular self-replication can be reached with or without chemical oscillations, and that a requirement common to both stationary and oscillatory cases is that a minimum spontaneous curvature of the membrane is required for the cell to divide once its area and volume are both doubled. The oscillatory case can result in a greater variety of cellular shape trajectories but raises additional constraints for cellular division and self-replication: (i) the ratio of doubling time to oscillation period should be an integer, and (ii) if the oscillation amplitude is sufficiently high, then the spontaneous curvature must be below a maximum value to avoid early division before the end of the cycle. Because of these additional stringent constraints, it is likely that early protocells did not rely upon chemical oscillations. Biochemical oscillations typical of modern evolved cells may have emerged later through evolution for other reasons (e.g., metabolic advantage) and must have required additional feedback mechanisms for such a self-replicating system to be robust against even slight environmental variations (e.g., temperature fluctuations).","2017-11","2021-08-04 12:47:15","2021-08-04 12:47:15","2021-08-04 12:47:15","453-480","","4","23","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\VLSADJCZ\Bigan and Plateau - 2017 - On the Relation between Chemical Oscillations and .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For example, cell communication via a diffusible factor allows for information to travel across large distances within the population, and cell polarization makes it possible to form structures with a particular orientation, but how do these processes interact to produce a more robust and regulated structure? In this study we investigate the ability of cells with different cellular characteristics to grow and maintain homeostatic structures. We do this in the context of an individual-based model where cell behavior is driven by an intracellular network that determines the cell phenotype. More precisely, we investigated evolution with 96 different permutations of our model, where cell motility, cell death, long-range growth factor (LGF), short-range growth factor (SGF), and cell polarization were either present or absent. The results show that LGF has the largest positive influence on the fitness of the evolved solutions. SGF and polarization also contribute, but all other capabilities essentially increase the search space, effectively making it more difficult to achieve a solution. By perturbing the evolved solutions, we found that they are highly robust to both mutations and wounding. In addition, we observed that by evolving solutions in more unstable environments they produce structures that were more robust and adaptive. In conclusion, our results suggest that robust collective behavior is most likely to evolve when cells are endowed with long-range communication, cell polarisation, and selection pressure from an unstable environment.","2017-08","2021-08-04 12:42:17","2021-08-04 12:42:17","2021-08-04 12:42:17","424-448","","3","23","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To what extent would perceptual and cognitive constraints similarly affect the evolution of musical systems? We conducted an experiment on the cultural evolution of artificial melodic systems, using multi-generational signaling games as a laboratory model of cultural transmission. Signaling systems, using five-tone sequences as signals, and basic and compound emotions as meanings, were transmitted from senders to receivers along diffusion chains in which the receiver in each game became the sender in the next game. During transmission, structural regularities accumulated in the signaling systems, following principles of proximity, symmetry, and good continuation. Although the compositionality of signaling systems did not increase significantly across generations, we did observe a significant increase in similarity among signals from the same set. We suggest that our experiment tapped into the cognitive and perceptual constraints operative in the cultural evolution of musical systems, which may differ from the mechanisms at play in language evolution and change.","2017-08","2021-08-04 12:42:11","2021-08-04 12:42:11","2021-08-04 12:42:11","406-423","","3","23","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\8MW6YL9B\Lumaca and Baggio - 2017 - Cultural Transmission and Evolution of Melodic Str.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These involved populations of competing individuals evolving by natural selection to learn to perform well on simplified abstract tasks, with the learning consisting of identifying regularities in their environment. In reality, there is more to learning than that type of direct individual experience, because it often includes a substantial degree of social learning that involves various forms of imitation of what other individuals have learned before them. This article rectifies that omission by incorporating memes and imitative learning into revised versions of the previous approach. To do this reliably requires formulating and testing a general framework for meme-based simulations that will enable more complete investigations of learning as a factor in any life history evolution scenarios. It does that by simulating imitative information transfer in terms of memes being passed between individuals, and developing a process for merging that information with the (possibly inconsistent) information acquired by direct experience, leading to a consistent overall body of learning. The proposed framework is tested on a range of learning variations and a representative set of life history factors to confirm the robustness of the approach. The simulations presented illustrate the types of interactions and tradeoffs that can emerge, and indicate the kinds of species-specific models that could be developed with this approach in the future.","2017-08","2021-08-04 12:42:06","2021-08-04 12:42:06","2021-08-04 12:42:06","374-405","","3","23","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\DZG6Y7D2\Bullinaria - 2017 - Imitative and Direct Learning as Interacting Facto.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this pipeline, increasingly embodied agents flow up through a sequence of increasingly physically realistic simulators, while data flows back down to improve the next transferral between neighboring simulators; physical reality is the last link in this chain. As a first proof of concept, we introduce a two-link chain: A fast yet low-fidelity ( lo-fi) simulator hosts minimally embodied agents, which gradually evolve controllers and morphologies to colonize a slow yet high-fidelity ( hi-fi) simulator. The agents are thus physically scaffolded. We show here that, given the same computational budget, these physically scaffolded robots reach higher performance in the hi-fi simulator than do robots that only evolve in the hi-fi simulator, but only for a sufficiently difficult task. These results suggest that a simulation-to-reality pipeline may strike a good balance between accelerating evolution in simulation while anchoring the results in reality, free the investigator from having to prespecify the robot's morphology, and pave the way to scalable, automated, robot-generating systems.","2017-08","2021-08-04 12:42:00","2021-08-04 12:42:00","2021-08-04 12:42:00","351-373","","3","23","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we use Asimov's laws to examine these notions in molecular robots fabricated from DNA origami. We successfully programmed these robots to obey, by means of interactions between individual robots in a large population, an appropriately scoped variant of Asimov's laws, and even emulate the key scenario from Asimov's story “Runaround,” in which a fictional robot gets into trouble despite adhering to the laws.

Significant features of the Amoeba system include the lack of artificial encapsulation (there is no write protection) and a computationally universal opcode basis set. Amoeba now includes two additional features: pattern-based addressing and injecting entropy into the system. It was previously thought such changes would make it highly unlikely that an ancestral replicator could emerge from a fortuitous combination of randomly selected opcodes. Instead, Amoeba shows a far richer emergence, exhibiting a self-organization phase followed by the emergence of self-replicators. First, the opcode basis set becomes biased. Second, short opcode building blocks are propagated throughout memory space. Finally, prebiotic building blocks can combine to form self-replicators.

To test diverse robot morphologies, robot legs of variable shapes were generated during the evolutionary process and autonomously built using additive fabrication. We present two cases with evo-devo experiments and one with evolution, and we hypothesize that the addition of a developmental stage can be used within robotics to improve performance. Moreover, our results show that a nonlinear system-environment interaction exists, which explains the nontrivial locomotion patterns observed. In the future, robots will be present in our daily lives, and this work introduces for the first time physical robots that evolve and grow while interacting with the environment.","2017-05","2021-08-04 12:40:08","2021-08-04 12:40:08","2021-08-04 12:40:08","169-185","","2","23","","Artificial Life","Evolutionary Developmental Robotics","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\T5A3PWH9\Vujovic et al. - 2017 - Evolutionary Developmental Robotics Improving Mor.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The reality gap and the ability to transfer phenotypes from simulation to reality constitute one such problem. Another lies in the embodiment of the evolutionary processes, which links to the first, but focuses on how evolution can act on real agents and occur independently from simulation, that is, going from being, as Eiben, Kernbach, & Haasdijk [2012, p. 261] put it, “the evolution of things, rather than just the evolution of digital objects.…” The work presented here investigates how fully autonomous evolution of robot controllers can be realized in hardware, using an industrial robot and a marker-based computer vision system. In particular, this article presents an approach to automate the reconfiguration of the test environment and shows that it is possible, for the first time, to incrementally evolve a neural robot controller for different obstacle avoidance tasks with no human intervention. Importantly, the system offers a high level of robustness and precision that could potentially open up the range of problems amenable to embodied evolution.","2017-05","2021-08-04 12:39:56","2021-08-04 12:39:56","2021-08-04 12:39:56","142-168","","2","23","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we investigate abstraction of the sensory inputs and motor actions as a tool to tackle this problem. Abstraction in robots is simply the use of preprocessed sensory inputs and low-level closed-loop control systems that execute higher-level motor commands. To demonstrate the impact abstraction could have, we evolved two controllers with different levels of abstraction to solve a task of forming an asymmetric triangle with a homogeneous swarm of micro air vehicles. The results show that although both controllers can effectively complete the task in simulation, the controller with the lower level of abstraction is not effective on the real vehicle, due to the reality gap. The controller with the higher level of abstraction is, however, effective both in simulation and in reality, suggesting that abstraction can be a useful tool in making evolved behavior robust to the reality gap. Additionally, abstraction aided in reducing the computational complexity of the simulation environment, speeding up the optimization process. Preeminently, we show that the optimized behavior exploits the environment (in this case the identical behavior of the other robots) and performs input shaping to allow the vehicles to fly into and maintain the required formation, demonstrating clear sensory-motor coordination. This shows that the power of the genetic optimization to find complex correlations is not necessarily lost through abstraction as some have suggested.","2017-05","2021-08-04 12:39:49","2021-08-04 12:39:49","2021-08-04 12:39:49","124-141","","2","23","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\UQL6ZRUL\Scheper and de Croon - 2017 - Abstraction, Sensory-Motor Coordination, and the R.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose an adaptive random Boolean network model in which each unit rewires its incoming arcs from other units to balance stability of its information processing based on the measurement of the local information transfer pattern. First, we show numerically that random Boolean networks can self-organize toward near dynamical criticality in our model. Second, the proposed model is analyzed by a mean-field theory.

Previous studies have shown that scale-free networks strongly promote cooperation. However, little is known about the invasion mechanism of cooperation in scale-free networks. To study microscopic and macroscopic behaviors of cooperators' invasion, we conducted computational experiments on the evolution of cooperation in scale-free networks where, starting from all defectors, cooperators can spontaneously emerge by mutation. Since the evolutionary dynamics are influenced by the definition of fitness, we tested two commonly adopted fitness functions: accumulated payoff and average payoff. Simulation results show that cooperation is strongly enhanced with the accumulated payoff fitness compared to the average payoff fitness. However, the difference between the two functions decreases as the average degree increases. As the average degree increases, cooperation decreases for the accumulated payoff fitness, while it increases for the average payoff fitness. Moreover, for the average payoff fitness, low-degree nodes play a more important role in spreading cooperative strategies than for the accumulated payoff fitness.","2017-02","2021-08-04 12:38:25","2021-08-04 12:38:25","2021-08-04 12:38:25","25-33","","1","23","","Artificial Life","Invasion of Cooperation in Scale-Free Networks","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\MJA97855\Ichinose and Sayama - 2017 - Invasion of Cooperation in Scale-Free Networks Ac.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Actually, the contribution of body morphology to cognition and control is rarely computational, in any useful sense of the word. We thus distinguish (1) morphology that facilitates control, (2) morphology that facilitates perception, and the rare cases of (3) morphological computation proper, such as reservoir computing, where the body is actually used for computation.

Its evolution is driven by biotic selection, that is (approximately), by natural selection rather than artificial selection. Whether or not Geb can generate an indefinite increase in maximum individual complexity is evaluated here by scaling two parameters: world length (which bounds population size) and the maximum number of neurons per individual. Maximum individual complexity is found to be asymptotically bounded when scaling either parameter alone. However, maximum individual complexity is found to be indefinitely scalable, to the extent evaluated so far (with run times in years and billions of reproductions per run), when scaling both world length and the maximum number of neurons per individual together. Further, maximum individual complexity is shown to scale logarithmically with (the lower of) maximum population size and maximum number of neurons per individual.

One hypothesized mechanism for evolvability is developmental canalization, wherein certain dimensions of variation become more likely to be traversed and others are prevented from being explored (e.g., offspring tend to have similar-size legs, and mutations affect the length of both legs, not each leg individually). While ubiquitous in nature, canalization is rarely reported in computational simulations of evolution, which deprives us of in silico examples of canalization to study and raises the question of which conditions give rise to this form of evolvability. Answering this question would shed light on why such evolvability emerged naturally, and it could accelerate engineering efforts to harness evolution to solve important engineering challenges. In this article, we reveal a unique system in which canalization did emerge in computational evolution. We document that genomes entrench certain dimensions of variation that were frequently explored during their evolutionary history. The genetic representation of these organisms also evolved to be more modular and hierarchical than expected by chance, and we show that these organizational properties correlate with increased fitness. Interestingly, the type of computational evolutionary experiment that produced this evolvability was very different from traditional digital evolution in that there was no objective, suggesting that open-ended, divergent evolutionary processes may be necessary for the evolution of evolvability.","2018-11","2021-08-04 12:33:47","2021-08-04 12:33:47","2021-08-04 12:33:47","157-181","","3","24","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\TZK79D6P\Huizinga et al. - 2018 - The Emergence of Canalization and Evolvability in .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For centuries, the study of music has been the sole prerogative of the humanities. Lately, however, music is being increasingly investigated by psychologists, neuroscientists, biologists, and computer scientists. One approach to studying the origins of music is to empirically test hypotheses about the mechanisms behind this structured behavior. Recent lab experiments show how musical rhythm and melody can emerge via the process of cultural transmission. In particular, Lumaca and Baggio (2017) tested the emergence of a sound system at the boundary between music and language. In this study, participants were given random pairs of signal-meanings; when participants negotiated their meaning and played a “game of telephone” with them, these pairs became more structured and systematic. Over time, the small biases introduced in each artificial transmission step accumulated, displaying quantitative trends, including the emergence, over the course of artificial human generations, of features resembling properties of language and music. In this Note, we highlight the importance of Lumaca and Baggio's experiment, place it in the broader literature on the evolution of language and music, and suggest refinements for future experiments. We conclude that, while psychological evidence for the emergence of proto-musical features is accumulating, complementary work is needed: Mathematical modeling and computer simulations should be used to test the internal consistency of experimentally generated hypotheses and to make new predictions.","2018-05","2021-08-04 12:33:00","2021-08-04 12:33:00","2021-08-04 12:33:00","149-153","","2","24","","Artificial Life","Which Melodic Universals Emerge from Repeated Signaling Games?","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\2UKIF7SZ\Ravignani and Verhoef - 2018 - Which Melodic Universals Emerge from Repeated Sign.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the other hand, neurobiological evidence argues for the hypothesis that language evolution has mainly related to an increasing of short-term memory capacity, which has allowed the online manipulation of words and meanings participating particularly in grammatical agreement systems. Here, the main aim is to propose a multi-agent language game for the emergence of a grammatical agreement system, under measurable long-range relations depending on the short-term memory capacity.

Here we aim at revealing a potential role of criticality of GRNs in morphogenesis, which is hard to uncover through the single-cell-level studies, especially from an evolutionary viewpoint. Our model simulated the growth of a cell population from a single seed cell. All the cells were assumed to have identical intracellular GRNs. We induced genetic perturbations to the GRN of the seed cell by adding, deleting, or switching a regulatory link between a pair of genes. From numerical simulations, we found that the criticality of GRNs facilitated the formation of nontrivial morphologies when the GRNs were critical in the presence of the evolutionary perturbations. Moreover, the criticality of GRNs produced topologically homogeneous cell clusters by adjusting the spatial arrangements of cells, which led to the formation of nontrivial morphogenetic patterns. Our findings correspond to an epigenetic viewpoint that heterogeneous and complex features emerge from homogeneous and less complex components through the interactions among them. Thus, our results imply that highly structured tissues or organs in morphogenesis of multicellular organisms might stem from the criticality of GRNs.","2018-05","2021-08-04 11:33:52","2021-08-04 11:33:52","2021-08-04 11:33:52","85-105","","2","24","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\9FWSNYI8\Kim and Sayama - 2018 - How Criticality of Gene Regulatory Networks Affect.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using methods derived from algorithmic complexity theory, we propose robust computational definitions of open-ended evolution and the adaptability of computable dynamical systems. Within this framework, we show that decidability imposes absolute limits on the stable growth of complexity in computable dynamical systems. Conversely, systems that exhibit (strong) open-ended evolution must be undecidable, establishing undecidability as a requirement for such systems. Complexity is assessed in terms of three measures: sophistication, coarse sophistication, and busy beaver logical depth. These three complexity measures assign low complexity values to random (incompressible) objects. As time grows, the stated complexity measures allow for the existence of complex states during the evolution of a computable dynamical system. We show, however, that finding these states involves undecidable computations. We conjecture that for similar complexity measures that assign low complexity values, decidability imposes comparable limits on the stable growth of complexity, and that such behavior is necessary for nontrivial evolutionary systems. We show that the undecidability of adapted states imposes novel and unpredictable behavior on the individuals or populations being modeled. Such behavior is irreducible.

We analyze abstract artificial life models of such systems, and note that some prominent examples rely on explicitly ahistorical frameworks; we point out where analyses that ignore a contingent historical context can be fatally flawed. The mathematical foundations of Gaia theory are presented in a form whose very basic and general assumptions point to wide applicability across complex dynamical systems.

This article presents a dynamic model of institutions, which views them as political game forms that generate the rules of a group's economic interactions. Unlike most prior work, the framework presented here allows for the construction of explicit models of the evolution of institutional rules. It takes account of the fact that group members are likely to try to create rules that benefit themselves. Following from this, it allows us to determine the conditions under which self-interested individuals will create institutional rules that support cooperation—for example, that prevent a tragedy of the commons. The article finishes with an example of how a model of the evolution of institutional rewards and punishments for promoting cooperation can be created. It is intended that this framework will allow artificial life researchers to examine how human groups can themselves create conditions for cooperation. This will help provide a better understanding of historical human social evolution, and facilitate the resolution of pressing societal social dilemmas.","2018-02","2021-08-04 11:31:24","2021-08-04 11:31:24","2021-08-04 11:31:24","10-28","","1","24","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\UKV5WHCY\Powers - 2018 - The Institutional Approach for Modeling the Evolut.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we consider the alternative possibility that in some cases, signal delay can be used functionally, that is, as an essential component of a cognitive system. To investigate this idea, we evolve a minimal robot controller to solve a basic stimulus-distinction task. The controller is constrained so that the solution must utilize a delayed recurrent signal. Different from previous evolutionary robotics studies, our controller is modeled using delay differential equations, which (unlike the ordinary differential equations of conventional continuous-time recurrent neural networks) can accurately capture delays in signal propagation. We analyze the evolved controller and its interaction with its environment using classical dynamical systems techniques. The analysis shows what kinds of invariant sets underlie the various successful and unsuccessful performances of the robot, and what kinds of bifurcations produce these invariant sets. In the second phase of our analysis, we turn our attention to the parameter θ, which describes the amount of signal delay included in the model. We show how the delay destabilizes certain attractors that would exist if there were no delay and creates other stable attractors, resulting in an agent that performs well at the target task.","2019-11","2021-08-04 11:28:52","2021-08-04 11:28:52","2021-08-04 11:28:52","315-333","","4","25","","Artificial Life","Can Signal Delay be Functional?","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\MP8NSGEE\Egbert et al. - 2019 - Can Signal Delay be Functional Including Delay in.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Computational modeling of these motion detectors has not only been providing effective solutions to artificial intelligence, but also benefiting the understanding of complicated biological visual systems. These biological mechanisms through millions of years of evolutionary development will have formed solid modules for constructing dynamic vision systems for future intelligent machines. This article reviews the computational motion perception models originating from biological research on insects' visual systems in the literature. These motion perception models or neural networks consist of the looming-sensitive neuronal models of lobula giant movement detectors (LGMDs) in locusts, the translation-sensitive neural systems of direction-selective neurons (DSNs) in fruit flies, bees, and locusts, and the small-target motion detectors (STMDs) in dragonflies and hoverflies. We also review the applications of these models to robots and vehicles. Through these modeling studies, we summarize the methodologies that generate different direction and size selectivity in motion perception. Finally, we discuss multiple systems integration and hardware realization of these bio-inspired motion perception models.","2019-08","2021-08-04 11:28:08","2021-08-04 11:28:08","2021-08-04 11:28:08","263-311","","3","25","","Artificial Life","Towards Computational Models and Applications of Insect Visual Systems for Motion Perception","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\3F8AE4EE\Fu et al. - 2019 - Towards Computational Models and Applications of I.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This reduction in mean fitness presents an opportunity for selection to restore fitness through the evolution of mutational robustness. In extreme cases, selection for mutational robustness can lead to flat genotypes (with low fitness but high robustness) outcompeting fit genotypes (with high fitness but low robustness)—a phenomenon known as survival of the flattest. While this effect was previously explored using the digital evolution system Avida, a complete analysis of the local fitness landscapes of fit and flat genotypes has been lacking, leading to uncertainty about the genetic basis of the survival-of-the-flattest effect. Here, we repeated the survival-of-the-flattest study and analyzed the mutational neighborhoods of fit and flat genotypes. We found that the flat genotypes, compared to the fit genotypes, had a reduced likelihood of deleterious mutations as well as an increased likelihood of neutral and, surprisingly, of lethal mutations. This trend holds for mutants one to four substitutions away from the wild-type sequence. We also found that flat genotypes have, on average, no epistasis between mutations, while fit genotypes have, on average, positive epistasis. Our results demonstrate that the genetic causes of mutational robustness on complex fitness landscapes are multifaceted. While the traditional idea of the survival of the flattest emphasized the evolution of increased neutrality, others have argued for increased mutational sensitivity in response to strong mutational loads. Our results show that both increased neutrality and increased lethality can lead to the evolution of mutational robustness. Furthermore, strong negative epistasis is not required for mutational sensitivity to lead to mutational robustness. Overall, these results suggest that mutational robustness is achieved by minimizing heritable deleterious variation.","2019-08","2021-08-04 11:28:00","2021-08-04 11:28:00","2021-08-04 11:28:00","250-262","","3","25","","Artificial Life","Mapping the Peaks","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\TWNRUNQG\Franklin et al. - 2019 - Mapping the Peaks Fitness Landscapes of the Fitte.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing upon earlier work by Banzhaf et al. (2016), three different kinds of open-endedness are identified: exploratory, expansive, and transformational. These are characterized in terms of their relationship to the search space of phenotypic behaviors. A formalism is introduced to describe three key processes required for an evolutionary process: the generation of a phenotype from a genetic description, the evaluation of that phenotype, and the reproduction with variation of individuals according to their evaluation. The formalism makes explicit various influences in each of these processes that can easily be overlooked. The distinction is made between intrinsic and extrinsic implementations of these processes. A discussion then investigates how various interactions between these processes, and their modes of implementation, can lead to open-endedness. However, an important contribution of the article is the demonstration that these considerations relate to exploratory open-endedness only. Conditions for the implementation of the more interesting kinds of open-endedness—expansive and transformational—are also discussed, emphasizing factors such as multiple domains of behavior, transdomain bridges, and non-additive compositional systems. In contrast to a traditional Darwinian analysis, these factors relate not to the generic evolutionary properties of individuals and populations, but rather to the nature of the building blocks out of which individual organisms are constructed, and the laws and properties of the environment in which they exist. The article ends with suggestions of how the framework can be used to categorize and compare the open-ended evolutionary potential of different systems, how it might guide the design of systems with greater capacity for open-ended evolution, and how it might be further improved.","2019-05","2021-08-04 11:26:42","2021-08-04 11:26:42","2021-08-04 11:26:42","207-224","","2","25","","Artificial Life","Evolutionary Innovations and Where to Find Them","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\QFSUBTFZ\Taylor - 2019 - Evolutionary Innovations and Where to Find Them R.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Much effort has been made to define such open-endedness so as to create forms of increasing complexity indefinitely. Here, however, a simple evolving computational system that satisfies all such requirements is presented. Doing so reveals a shortcoming in the definitions for open-ended evolution. The goal to create models that rival biological complexity remains. This work suggests that our current definitions allow for even simple models to pass as open-ended, and that our definitions of complexity and diversity are more important for the quest of open-ended evolution than the fact that something runs indefinitely.","2019-05","2021-08-04 11:26:31","2021-08-04 11:26:31","2021-08-04 11:26:31","198-206","","2","25","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\UQ6I26BT\Hintze - 2019 - Open-Endedness for the Sake of Open-Endedness.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we hope to bridge that gap by reviewing common barriers to open-endedness in the evolution-inspired approach and how they are dealt with in the evolutionary case—collapse of diversity, saturation of complexity, and failure to form new kinds of individuality. We then show how these problems map onto similar ones in the machine learning approach, and discuss how the same insights and solutions that alleviated those barriers in evolutionary approaches can be ported over. At the same time, the form these issues take in the machine learning formulation suggests new ways to analyze and resolve barriers to open-endedness.

Alas, these transitions are challenging to induce or detect, even with computational organisms. Here, we introduce the DISHTINY (Distributed Hierarchical Transitions in Individuality) platform, which provides simple cell-like organisms with the ability and incentive to unite into new individuals in a manner that can continue to scale to subsequent transitions. The system is designed to encourage these transitions so that they can be studied: Organisms that coordinate spatiotemporally can maximize the rate of resource harvest, which is closely linked to their reproductive ability. We demonstrate the hierarchical emergence of multiple levels of individuality among simple cell-like organisms that evolve parameters for manually designed strategies. During evolution, we observe reproductive division of labor and close cooperation among cells, including resource-sharing, aggregation of resource endowments for propagules, and emergence of an apoptosis response to somatic mutation.

I propose that facilitating formation of higher-order entities is a generalizable, effective way to cause a cardinality leap in the set of possibilities that promotes open-endedness. I demonstrate this idea with a simple, proof-of-concept toy model called Hash Chemistry that uses a hash function as a fitness evaluator of evolving entities of any size or order. Simulation results showed that the cumulative number of unique replicating entities that appeared in evolution increased almost linearly along time without an apparent bound, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed cardinality leap. It was also observed that the number of individual entities involved in a single replication event gradually increased over time, indicating evolutionary appearance of higher-order entities. Moreover, these behaviors were not observed in control experiments in which fitness evaluators were replaced by random number generators. This strongly suggests that the dynamics observed in Hash Chemistry were indeed evolutionary behaviors driven by selection and adaptation taking place at multiple scales.","2019-05","2021-08-04 11:25:26","2021-08-04 11:25:26","2021-08-04 11:25:26","104-116","","2","25","","Artificial Life","Cardinality Leap for Open-Ended Evolution","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\86XHXBFN\Sayama - 2019 - Cardinality Leap for Open-Ended Evolution Theoret.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To this end, we provide detailed algorithms (including C++ implementations) for these metrics that should be easy to incorporate into existing artificial life systems. Furthermore, we expect this toolbox to continue to grow as researchers implement these metrics in new languages and as the community reaches consensus about additional hallmarks of open-ended evolution. For example, we would welcome a measurement of a system's potential to produce major transitions in individuality. To confirm that our metrics accurately measure the hallmarks we are interested in, we test them on two very different experimental systems: NK landscapes and the Avida digital evolution platform. We find that our observed results are consistent with our prior knowledge about these systems, suggesting that our proposed metrics are effective and should generalize to other systems.","2019-04","2021-08-04 11:23:55","2021-08-04 11:23:55","2021-08-04 11:23:55","50-73","","1","25","","Artificial Life","The MODES Toolbox","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\47MLAJY5\Dolson et al. - 2019 - The MODES Toolbox Measurements of Open-Ended Dyna.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present long-term coevolutionary simulations showing that larger population sizes tend to support greater escalation of complexity than smaller ones do.

The former suffices in systems whose size and interactions do not change substantially over time, while the latter is a key property of open-ended evolution, where new players and interaction types enter the game. We first investigate systems from physics, biology, and engineering and argue that their evolutionary optimization dynamics is the cumulative effect of multiple independent events, or quakes, which are uniformly distributed on a logarithmic time scale and produce a decelerating fitness improvement when using the appropriate independent variable. The appropriate independent variable can be physical time for a disordered magnetic system, the number of generations for a bacterial system, or the number of produced units for a particular technological product. We then derive and discuss a simple microscopic theory that explains the nature of the involved optimization processes, and provide simulation results as illustration. Finally, we explore the evolution of human culture and technology, using empirical economic data as a proxy for human fitness. Assuming the overall dynamics is a combined optimization and expansion process, the two processes can be separated and quantified by superimposing the mathematical form of an optimization process on the empirical data and thereby transforming the independent variable. This variable turns out to increase faster than any exponential function of time, a property likely due to strong historical changes in the web of human interactions and to the associated increase in the amount of available knowledge. A microscopic theory for this time dependence remains, however, a challenging open problem.","2019-04","2021-08-04 11:23:36","2021-08-04 11:23:36","2021-08-04 11:23:36","9-21","","1","25","","Artificial Life","Two Modes of Evolution","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\RG3YYTMN\Rasmussen and Sibani - 2019 - Two Modes of Evolution Optimization and Expansion.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, we demonstrate that best performance is obtained when the environment varies at a moderate rate across generations, that is, when the environment does not vary every generation but every N generations. The advantage of exposing evolving agents to environments that vary across generations at a moderate rate is due, at least in part, to the fact that this condition maximizes the retention of changes that alter the behavior of the agents, which in turn facilitates the discovery of better solutions. Finally, we demonstrate that moderate environmental variations are advantageous also from an evolutionary computation perspective, that is, from the perspective of maximizing the performance that can be achieved within a limited computational budget.","2019-03","2021-08-04 11:22:26","2021-08-04 11:22:26","2021-08-04 11:22:26","277-295","","4","24","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is an excellent platform for addressing topics in long-term evolution and paleobiology, such as mass extinction and recovery, with experimental evolutionary approaches. We evolved model communities with ecological interdependence among community members, which were subjected to two principal types of mass extinction: a pulse extinction that killed randomly, and a selective press extinction involving an alteration of the abiotic environment to which the communities had to adapt. These treatments were applied at two different strengths, along with unperturbed control experiments. We examined how stability in the digital communities was affected from the perspectives of division of labor, relative shift in rank abundance, and genealogical connectedness of the community's component ecotypes. Mass extinction that was due to a Strong Press treatment was most effective in producing reshaped communities that differed from the pre-treatment ones in all of the measured perspectives; weaker versions of the treatments did not generally produce significant departures from a Control treatment; and results for the Strong Pulse treatment generally fell between those extremes. The Strong Pulse treatment differed from others in that it produced a slight but detectable shift towards more generalized communities. Compared to Press treatments, Pulse treatments also showed a greater contribution from re-evolved ecological doppelgangers rather than new ecotypes. However, relatively few Control communities showed stability in any of these metrics over the whole course of the experiment, and most did not represent stable states (by some measure of stability) that were disrupted by the extinction treatments. Our results have interesting, broad qualitative parallels with findings from the paleontological record, and show the potential of digital evolution studies to illuminate many aspects of mass extinction and recovery by addressing them in a truly experimental manner.","2019-03","2021-08-04 11:22:17","2021-08-04 11:22:17","2021-08-04 11:22:17","250-276","","4","24","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\2JPWJK9F\Luo et al. - 2019 - Examining Community Stability in the Face of Mass .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These types of interactions are ubiquitous in nature, with more being discovered regularly. Mutualisms are vital to humankind: Pollinators and soil microbes are critical in agriculture, bacterial microbiomes regulate our health, and domesticated animals provide us with food and companionship. Many hypotheses exist on how mutualisms evolve; however, they are difficult to evaluate without bias, due to the fragile and idiosyncratic systems most often investigated. Instead, we have created an artificial life simulation, Symbulation, which we use to examine mutualism evolution based on (1) the probability of vertical transmission (symbiont being passed to offspring) and (2) the spatial structure of the environment. We found that spatial structure can lead to less mutualism at intermediate vertical transmission rates. We provide evidence that this effect is due to the ability of quasi species to purge parasites, reducing the diversity of available symbionts. Our simulation is easily extended to test many additional hypotheses about the evolution of mutualism and serves as a general model to quantitatively compare how different environments affect the evolution of mutualism.","2019-03","2021-08-04 11:22:09","2021-08-04 11:22:09","2021-08-04 11:22:09","229-249","","4","24","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\2V3AKWHN\Vostinar and Ofria - 2019 - Spatial Structure Can Decrease Symbiotic Cooperati.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Processes of this kind characterize both living and artificial systems, making self-organization a concept that is at the basis of several disciplines, from physics to biology and engineering. Placed at the frontiers between disciplines, artificial life (ALife) has heavily borrowed concepts and tools from the study of self-organization, providing mechanistic interpretations of lifelike phenomena as well as useful constructivist approaches to artificial system design. Despite its broad usage within ALife, the concept of self-organization has been often excessively stretched or misinterpreted, calling for a clarification that could help with tracing the borders between what can and cannot be considered self-organization. In this review, we discuss the fundamental aspects of self-organization and list the main usages within three primary ALife domains, namely “soft” (mathematical/computational modeling), “hard” (physical robots), and “wet” (chemical/biological systems) ALife. We also provide a classification to locate this research. Finally, we discuss the usefulness of self-organization and related concepts within ALife studies, point to perspectives and challenges for future research, and list open questions.

The Miranda machine is an abstract Turing-machine-like processor, which manipulates a sequence of DNA symbols according to a set of programming instructions. This process generates a pool of new DNA strands, which are subsequently translated into rhythms. GeMS represents the musical equivalent of amino acids in terms of rhythms, referred to as rhythmic codons. This enables the rhythmator to convert DNA sequences into rhythmic sequences. The pitch processor generates pitches for such rhythmic sequences. It is inspired by the phenomenon of protein folding. The pitch processor considers orientation information of DNA instructions yielded by the Miranda machine in order to activate algorithms for generating pitches.

In the simulation, the fitness of an entity is measured by a series of one-on-one competitions in the Immigration Game, a two-player variation of Conway's Game of Life. Mutation, reproduction, and symbiosis are implemented as operations that are external to the Immigration Game. Because these operations are external to the game, we can freely manipulate the operations and observe the effects of the manipulations. The simulation is composed of four layers, each layer building on the previous layer. The first layer implements a simple form of asexual reproduction, the second layer introduces a more sophisticated form of asexual reproduction, the third layer adds sexual reproduction, and the fourth layer adds symbiosis. The experiments show that a small amount of symbiosis, added to the other layers, significantly increases the fitness of the population.

However, the creativity of evolution is not limited to the natural world: Artificial organisms evolving in computational environments have also elicited surprise and wonder from the researchers studying them. The process of evolution is an algorithmic process that transcends the substrate in which it occurs. Indeed, many researchers in the field of digital evolution can provide examples of how their evolving algorithms and organisms have creatively subverted their expectations or intentions, exposed unrecognized bugs in their code, produced unexpectedly adaptations, or engaged in behaviors and outcomes, uncannily convergent with ones found in nature. Such stories routinely reveal surprise and creativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely fit into the standard scientific narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles to be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their own right. Bugs are fixed, experiments are refocused, and one-off surprises are collapsed into a single data point. The stories themselves are traded among researchers through oral tradition, but that mode of information transmission is inefficient and prone to error and outright loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared only among practitioners means that many natural scientists do not realize how interesting and lifelike digital organisms are and how natural their evolution can be. To our knowledge, no collection of such anecdotes has been published before. This article is the crowd-sourced product of researchers in the fields of artificial life and evolutionary computation who have provided first-hand accounts of such cases. It thus serves as a written, fact-checked collection of scientifically important and even entertaining stories. In doing so we also present here substantial evidence that the existence and importance of evolutionary surprises extends beyond the natural world, and may indeed be a universal property of all complex evolving systems.","2020-05","2021-08-04 10:26:11","2021-08-04 10:26:11","2021-08-04 10:26:11","274-306","","2","26","","Artificial Life","The Surprising Creativity of Digital Evolution","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\7QNMGGY9\Lehman et al. - 2020 - The Surprising Creativity of Digital Evolution A .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose a simple decentralized control scheme for swarm robots by extending our previously proposed non-reciprocal-interaction-based model. Each robot has an internal state, called its workload. Each robot first moves randomly to find a task, and when it does, its workload increases, and then it attracts its neighboring robots to ask for their help.

English verbs are of two types: regular verbs, which form their past tense based on a productive rule, and irregular verbs, which form their past tenses through exceptions to that rule. Although many connectionist models exist for capturing language development, few consider individual differences. In this article, we explore the use of populations of artificial neural networks (ANNs) that evolve according to behavioral genetics principles in order to create computational models capable of capturing the population variability exhibited by children in acquiring English past tense verbs. Literature in the field of behavioral genetics views variability in children's learning in terms of genetic and environmental influences. In our model, the effects of genetic influences are simulated through variations in parameters controlling computational properties of ANNs, and the effects of environmental influences are simulated via a filter applied to the training set. This filter alters the quality of information available to the artificial learning system and creates a unique subsample of the training set for each simulated individual. Our approach uses a population of twins to disentangle genetic and environmental influences on past tense performance and to capture the wide range of variability exhibited by children as they learn English past tenses. We use a novel technique to create the population of ANN twins based on the biological processes of meiosis and fertilization. This approach allows modeling of both individual differences and development (within the lifespan of an individual) in a single framework. Finally, our approach permits the application of selection on developmental performance on the quasi-regular task across generations. Setting individual differences within an evolutionary framework is an important and novel contribution of our work. We present an experimental evaluation of this model, focusing on individual differences in performance. The experiments led to several novel findings, including: divergence of population attributes during selection to favor regular verbs, irregular verbs, or both; evidence of canalization, analogous to Waddington's developmental epigenetic landscape, once selection starts targeting a particular aspect of the task domain; and the limiting effect on the power of selection in the face of stochastic selection (roulette wheel), sexual reproduction, and a variable learning environment for each individual. Most notably, the heritability of traits showed an inverse relationship to optimization. Selected traits show lower heritability as the genetic variation of the population reduces. The simulations demonstrate the viability of linking concepts such as heritability of individual differences, cognitive development, and selection over generations within a single computational framework.","2020-05","2021-08-04 10:25:46","2021-08-04 10:25:46","2021-08-04 10:25:46","217-241","","2","26","","Artificial Life","Evolving Connectionist Models to Capture Population Variability across Language Development","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\GVRWBISL\Kohli et al. - 2020 - Evolving Connectionist Models to Capture Populatio.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Digital evolution, a computer-based instantiation of Darwinian evolution in which short self-replicating computer programs compete, mutate, and evolve, is an excellent platform for investigating such topics in a rigorous experimental manner. We evolved model communities with ecological interdependence among community members, which were subjected to two principal types of mass extinction: a pulse extinction that killed randomly, and a selective press extinction involving an alteration of the abiotic environment to which the communities had to adapt. These treatments were applied at two different strengths (Strong and Weak), along with unperturbed Control experiments. We performed several kinds of competition experiments using simplified versions of these communities to see whether long-term stability that was implied previously by ecological and phylogenetic metrics was also reflected in performance, namely, whether fitness was static over long periods of time. Results from Control and Weak treatment communities revealed almost completely transitive evolution, while Strong treatment communities showed higher incidences of temporal intransitivity, with pre-treatment ecotypes often able to displace some of their post-recovery successors. However, pre-treatment carryovers more often had lower fitness in mixed communities than in their own fully native conditions. Replacement and invasion experiments pitting single ecotypes against pre-treatment reference communities showed that many of the invading ecotypes could measurably alter the fitnesses of one or more residents, usually with depressive effects, and that the strength of these effects increased over time even in the most stable communities. However, invaders taken from Strong treatment communities often had little or no effect on resident performance. While we detected periods of time when the fitness of a particular evolving ecotype remained static, this stasis was not permanent and never affected an entire community at once. Our results lend support to the fitness-deterioration interpretation of the Red Queen hypothesis, and highlight community context dependence in determining fitness, the shaping of communities by both biotic factors and abiotic forcing, and the illusory nature of evolutionary stasis. Our results also demonstrate the potential of digital evolution studies to illuminate many aspects of evolution in interacting multispecies communities.","2020-05","2021-08-04 10:25:39","2021-08-04 10:25:39","2021-08-04 10:25:39","196-216","","2","26","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\VFNAK8I9\Luo et al. - 2020 - Alteration of (Frequency-Dependent) Fitness in Tim.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To study the autonomous regulation of a self-boundary, we focus on neural homeodynamic responses to environmental changes using both biological and artificial neural networks. Previous studies showed that embodied cultured neural networks and spiking neural networks with spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) learn an action as they avoid stimulation from outside. In this article, as a result of our experiments using embodied cultured neurons, we find that there is also a second property allowing the network to avoid stimulation: If the agent cannot learn an action to avoid the external stimuli, it tends to decrease the stimulus-evoked spikes, as if to ignore the uncontrollable input. We also show such a behavior is reproduced by spiking neural networks with asymmetric STDP. We consider that these properties are to be regarded as autonomous regulation of self and nonself for the network, in which a controllable neuron is regarded as self, and an uncontrollable neuron is regarded as nonself. Finally, we introduce neural autopoiesis by proposing the principle of stimulus avoidance.","2020-04","2021-08-04 10:09:36","2021-08-04 10:09:36","2021-08-04 10:09:36","130-151","","1","26","","Artificial Life","Neural Autopoiesis","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\JKCBN86B\Masumori et al. - 2020 - Neural Autopoiesis Organizing Self-Boundaries by .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Numerous systems, from sandpiles to gene regulatory networks to swarms to human brains, seem to work towards preserving a precarious balance right at their critical point. Understanding criticality therefore seems strongly related to a broad, fundamental theory for the physics of life as it could be, which still lacks a clear description of how life can arise and maintain itself in complex systems. In order to investigate this crucial question, we model populations of Ising agents competing for resources in a simple 2D environment subject to an evolutionary algorithm. We then compare its evolutionary dynamics under different experimental conditions. We demonstrate the utility that arises at a critical state and contrast it with the behaviors and dynamics that arise far from criticality. The results show compelling evidence that not only is a critical state remarkable in its ability to adapt and find solutions to the environment, but the evolving parameters in the agents tend to flow towards criticality if starting from a supercritical regime. We present simulations showing that a system in a supercritical state will tend to self-organize towards criticality, in contrast to a subcritical state, which remains subcritical though it is still capable of adapting and increasing its fitness.","2020-04","2021-08-04 10:09:29","2021-08-04 10:09:29","2021-08-04 10:09:29","112-129","","1","26","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\DZ49E8FC\Khajehabdollahi and Witkowski - 2020 - Evolution Towards Criticality in Ising Neural Agen.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We test for evolvability using the hierarchical if-and-only-if (h-iff) function as a deceptive fitness landscape together with a steady state genetic algorithm (SSGA) with a variable mutation rate and indiscriminate intrinsic mortality rate. The mutation rate and the intrinsic mortality rate display a relationship for finding the global maximum. This relationship was also found when implementing the same deceptive fitness landscape in a spatial model consisting of an evolving population. We also compared the performance of the optimal mutation and mortality rate with a state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm called age-fitness Pareto optimization (AFPO) and show how the two approaches traverse the h-iff landscape differently. Our results indicate that the intrinsic mortality rate and mutation rate induce random genetic drift that allows a population to efficiently traverse a deceptive fitness landscape.

Additionally, we suggest the adoption of four phylogeny measurements from biology: phylogenetic richness, phylogenetic divergence, phylogenetic regularity, and depth of the most-recent common ancestor. In addition to quantitative metrics, we also discuss several existing data visualizations that are useful for understanding lineages and phylogenies: state sequence visualizations, fitness landscape overlays, phylogenetic trees, and Muller plots. We examine the behavior of these metrics (with the aid of data visualizations) in two well-studied computational contexts: (1) a set of two-dimensional, real-valued optimization problems under a range of mutation rates and selection strengths, and (2) a set of qualitatively different environments in the Avida digital evolution platform.

We observed that in most simulations, organisms become complex although such organisms are a lot less fit than simple ones and have no robustness or evolvability advantage. This excludes selection from the set of possible explanations for the evolution of complexity. However, complementary experiments showed that selection is nevertheless necessary for complexity to evolve, also excluding non-selective effects. Analyzing the long-term fate of complex organisms, we showed that complex organisms almost never switch back to simplicity despite the potential fitness benefit. On the contrary, they consistently accumulate complexity in the long term, meanwhile slowly increasing their fitness but never overtaking that of simple organisms. This suggests the existence of a complexity ratchet powered by negative epistasis: Mutations leading to simple solutions, which are favorable at the beginning of the simulation, become deleterious after other mutations—leading to complex solutions—have been fixed. This also suggests that this complexity ratchet cannot be beaten by selection, but that it can be overthrown by robustness because of the constraints it imposes on the coding capacity of the genome.","2020-04","2021-08-04 10:08:48","2021-08-04 10:08:48","2021-08-04 10:08:48","38-57","","1","26","","Artificial Life","The Complexity Ratchet","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\SY3E4CU4\Liard et al. - 2020 - The Complexity Ratchet Stronger than Selection, S.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The state of the art is to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that measures millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) throughout the genome followed by a one-SNP-at-a-time statistical analysis to detect univariate associations. This approach has identified thousands of genetic risk factors for hundreds of diseases. However, the genetic risk factors detected have very small effect sizes and collectively explain very little of the overall heritability of the disease. Nonetheless, it is assumed that the genetic component of risk is due to many independent risk factors that contribute additively. The fact that many genetic risk factors with small effects can be detected is taken as evidence to support this notion. It is our working hypothesis that the genetic architecture of common diseases is partly driven by non-additive interactions. To test this hypothesis, we developed a heuristic simulation-based method for conducting experiments about the complexity of genetic architecture. We show that a genetic architecture driven by complex interactions is highly consistent with the magnitude and distribution of univariate effects seen in real data. We compare our results with measures of univariate and interaction effects from two large-scale GWASs of sporadic breast cancer and find evidence to support our hypothesis that is consistent with the results of our computational experiment.","2020-04","2021-08-04 10:07:21","2021-08-04 10:07:21","2021-08-04 10:07:21","23-37","","1","26","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\CI62CDRF\Moore et al. - 2020 - How Computational Experiments Can Improve Our Unde.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One such system is a self-reproducing extraterrestrial robotic colony, which reduces the launch payload mass for space exploration compared to current mission configurations. In this work, self-reproduction is achieved by the actions of a robot on available resources. An important consideration for the establishment of any self-reproducing system is the identification of a seed, for instance, a set of resources and a set of robots that utilize them to produce all of the robots in the colony. This article outlines a novel algorithm to determine an optimal seed for self-reproducing systems, with application to a self-reproducing extraterrestrial robotic colony. Optimality is understood as the minimization of a cost function of the resources and, in this article, the robots. Since artificial self-reproduction is currently an open problem, the algorithm is illustrated with a simple robotic self-replicating system from the literature and with a more complicated self-reproducing example from nature.","2011-12","2021-08-04 14:41:55","2021-08-04 14:41:55","2021-08-04 14:41:55","27-51","","1","18","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This mutual influence can function as an in-the-moment, intrinsic evaluation of the adaptive value of a novel situation, such as an encounter with a compound that activates new metabolic pathways. Our model demonstrates how changes to metabolic pathways can lead to improvement of behavioral strategies, and conversely, how behavior can contribute to the exploration and fixation of new metabolic pathways. These examples indicate the potentially important role that the interplay between behavior and metabolism could have played in shaping adaptive evolution in early life and protolife. We argue that the processes illustrated by these models can be interpreted as an unorthodox instantiation of the principles of evolution by random variation and selective retention. We then discuss how the interaction between metabolism and behavior can facilitate evolution through (i) increasing exposure to environmental variation, (ii) making more likely the fixation of some beneficial metabolic pathways, (iii) providing a mechanism for in-the-moment adaptation to changes in the environment and to changes in the organization of the organism itself, and (iv) generating conditions that are conducive to speciation.","2011-12","2021-08-04 14:41:47","2021-08-04 14:41:47","2021-08-04 14:41:47","1-25","","1","18","","Artificial Life","Behavioral Metabolution","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\6FWQ8WDN\Egbert et al. - 2011 - Behavioral Metabolution The Adaptive and Evolutio.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This concept is underrepresented in previous work on string-based chemistries. We argue that small-world mutation networks will confer better exploration of the evolutionary space than either random or fully regular mutation strategies. We calculate network statistics from two data sets: amino acid substitution matrices, and codon-level single point mutations. The first class are observed data from protein alignments; while the second class is defined by the standard genetic code that is used to translate RNA into amino acids.

To generate dynamic behavior for this experiment, we imbue the nodes in these networks with random Boolean functions. We find that the ordered phase of the dynamics (low activity in dynamics) and topologies with low randomness are dominated by information storage, while the chaotic phase (high activity in dynamics) and topologies with high randomness are dominated by information transfer.

The generation of networks that resemble the real world turns out in itself to be a complex search problem. We present a new rewiring algorithm for the generation of networks with unique characteristics that combine the scale-free effects and community structures encountered in the real world. The algorithm is inspired by social interactions in the real world, whereby people tend to connect locally while occasionally they connect globally. This local-global coupling turns out to be a powerful characteristics that is required for our proposed rewiring algorithm to generate networks with community structures, power law distributions both in degree and in community size, positive assortative mixing by degree, and the rich-club phenomenon.","2011-10","2021-08-04 14:40:46","2021-08-04 14:40:46","2021-08-04 14:40:46","263-279","","4","17","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In spite of the increasing societal importance of online social networks, it is unknown whether assortative mixing of psychological states takes place in situations where social ties are mediated solely by online networking services in the absence of physical contact. Here, we show that the general happiness, or subjective well-being (SWB), of Twitter users, as measured from a 6-month record of their individual tweets, is indeed assortative across the Twitter social network. Our results imply that online social networks may be equally subject to the social mechanisms that cause assortative mixing in real social networks and that such assortative mixing takes place at the level of SWB. Given the increasing prevalence of online social networks, their propensity to connect users with similar levels of SWB may be an important factor in how positive and negative sentiments are maintained and spread through human society.

A specific model for the prebiological evolution of a reproducing system with rudimentary versions of these three interdependent subsystems is presented. This is based on the initial emergence and reproduction of autocatalytic networks in hydrothermal microcompartments containing iron sulfide. The driving force for life was catalysis of the dissipation of the intrinsic redox gradient of the planet. The codependence of life on iron and phosphate provides chemical constraints on the ordering of prebiological evolution. The initial protometabolism was based on positive feedback loops associated with in situ carbon fixation in which the initial protometabolites modified the catalytic capacity and mobility of metal-based catalysts, especially iron-sulfur centers. A number of selection mechanisms, including catalytic efficiency and specificity, hydrolytic stability, and selective solubilization, are proposed as key determinants for autocatalytic reproduction exploited in protometabolic evolution. This evolutionary process led from autocatalytic networks within preexisting compartments to discrete, reproducing, mobile vesicular protocells with the capacity to use soluble sugar phosphates and hence the opportunity to develop nucleic acids. Fidelity of information transfer in the reproduction of these increasingly complex autocatalytic networks is a key selection pressure in prebiological evolution that eventually leads to the selection of nucleic acids as a digital information subsystem and hence the emergence of fully functional chemotons capable of Darwinian evolution.","2011-07","2021-08-04 14:36:55","2021-08-04 14:36:55","2021-08-04 14:36:55","203-217","","3","17","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is particularly true for collective and swarm robotics, in which the desired behavior of the group is an indirect result of the control and communication rules followed by each individual. However, the experimenter must make several arbitrary choices in setting up the evolutionary process, in order to define the correct selective pressures that can lead to the desired results. In some cases, only a deep understanding of the obtained results can point to the critical aspects that constrain the system, which can be later modified in order to re-engineer the evolutionary process towards better solutions.

In general, agents will opt for the behavior that is the best compromise (for them) of the many conflicting constraints created by their neighbors, but the attractors of the system as a whole will not maximize total utility. We then consider agents that act as creatures of habit by increasing their preference to coordinate (anticoordinate) with whichever neighbors they are coordinated (anticoordinated) with at present. These preferences change slowly while the system is repeatedly perturbed, so that it settles to many different local attractors. We find that under these conditions, with each perturbation there is a progressively higher chance of the system settling to a configuration with high total utility. Eventually, only one attractor remains, and that attractor is very likely to maximize (or almost maximize) global utility. This counterintuitive result can be understood using theory from computational neuroscience; we show that this simple form of habituation is equivalent to Hebbian learning, and the improved optimization of global utility that is observed results from well-known generalization capabilities of associative memory acting at the network scale. This causes the system of selfish agents, each acting individually but habitually, to collectively identify configurations that maximize total utility.","2011-07","2021-08-04 14:36:43","2021-08-04 14:36:43","2021-08-04 14:36:43","167-181","","3","17","","Artificial Life","“If You Can't Be With the One You Love, Love the One You're With”","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\D4EJ9488\Davies et al. - 2011 - “If You Can't Be With the One You Love, Love the O.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the general conditions for such an outcome are poorly understood and present a fundamental open question for domains as varied as ecology, sociology, economics, organismic biology, and technological infrastructure design. In contrast, sufficient conditions for artificial neural networks to form structures that perform collective computational processes such as associative memory/recall, classification, generalization, and optimization are well understood. Such global functions within a single agent or organism are not wholly surprising, since the mechanisms (e.g., Hebbian learning) that create these neural organizations may be selected for this purpose; but agents in a multi-agent system have no obvious reason to adhere to such a structuring protocol or produce such global behaviors when acting from individual self-interest. However, Hebbian learning is actually a very simple and fully distributed habituation or positive feedback principle. Here we show that when self-interested agents can modify how they are affected by other agents (e.g., when they can influence which other agents they interact with), then, in adapting these inter-agent relationships to maximize their own utility, they will necessarily alter them in a manner homologous with Hebbian learning. Multi-agent systems with adaptable relationships will thereby exhibit the same system-level behaviors as neural networks under Hebbian learning. For example, improved global efficiency in multi-agent systems can be explained by the inherent ability of associative memory to generalize by idealizing stored patterns and/or creating new combinations of subpatterns. Thus distributed multi-agent systems can spontaneously exhibit adaptive global behaviors in the same sense, and by the same mechanism, as with the organizational principles familiar in connectionist models of organismic learning.","2011-07","2021-08-04 14:36:37","2021-08-04 14:36:37","2021-08-04 14:36:37","147-166","","3","17","","Artificial Life","Global Adaptation in Networks of Selfish Components","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\TRY25FFE\Watson et al. - 2011 - Global Adaptation in Networks of Selfish Component.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this letter, the behavior of the series is considered an ecological process of artificial organisms (1s in bit strings). The Collatz conjecture is then reinterpreted as the competition between population growth and extinction. This new interpretation has made it possible to analytically calculate the growth and extinction speeds of bit strings. The results indicate that the extinction is always faster than the growth, providing an ecological explanation for the conjecture.

The cybernetic definition of a living individual I proposed previously is used in the present work. I argue that artificial, supramolecular living individuals existing self-dependently in the environment of some distant planet must have the form of dispersed individuals composed of several separate subindividuals that are integrated functionally, but not structurally. These subindividuals would be analogous to such modules of human technical civilization as machines, robots, steelworks, chemical plants, electronic factories, power stations, and mines.

It is commonly argued that network modularity is beneficial under noisy conditions, but experimental support for this is still very limited.

Group selection links the survival of the individual to the survival of its group, thus encouraging cooperation. Previous approaches to engineering synchronization and desynchronization algorithms have taken inspiration from nature: In the well-known firefly model, the only form of communication between agents is in the form of flash messages among neighbors. Here we demonstrate that populations of digital organisms, provided with a similar mechanism and minimal information about their environment, are capable of evolving algorithms for synchronization and desynchronization, and that the evolved behaviors are robust to message loss. We further describe how the evolved behavior for synchronization mimics that of the well-known Ermentrout model for firefly synchronization in biology.

The wound response is mediated by a signal transduction and regulatory network. Molecular studies in Arabidopsis have identified the COI1 gene as a central component of this network. Current models of these networks qualitatively describe the wound response, but they are not directly assessed using quantitative gene expression data. We built a model comprising the key components of the Arabidopsis wound response using the transsys framework. For comparison, we constructed a null model that is devoid of any regulatory interactions, and various alternative models by rewiring the wound response model. All models were parametrized by computational optimization to generate synthetic gene expression profiles that approximate the empirical data set. We scored the fit of the synthetic to the empirical data with various distance measures, and used the median distance after optimization to directly and quantitatively assess the wound response model and its alternatives. Discrimination of candidate models depends substantially on the measure of gene expression profile distance. Using the null model to assess quality of the distance measures for discrimination, we identify correlation of log-ratio profiles as the most suitable distance. Our wound response model fits the empirical data significantly better than the alternative models. Gradual perturbation of the wound response model results in a corresponding gradual decline in fit. The optimization approach provides insights into biologically relevant features, such as robustness. It is a step toward enabling integrative studies of multiple cross-talking pathways, and thus may help to develop our understanding how the genome informs the mapping of environmental signals to phenotypic traits.","2012-10","2021-08-04 14:27:28","2021-08-04 14:27:28","2021-08-04 14:27:28","445-460","","4","18","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By equipping some individuals with the capacity of assessing the intentions of others in the course of a prototypical dilemma of cooperation—the repeated prisoner's dilemma—we show how intention recognition is favored by natural selection, opening a window of opportunity for cooperation to thrive. We introduce a new strategy (IR) that is able to assign an intention to the actions of opponents, on the basis of an acquired corpus consisting of possible plans achieving that intention, as well as to then make decisions on the basis of such recognized intentions. The success of IR is grounded on the free exploitation of unconditional cooperators while remaining robust against unconditional defectors. In addition, we show how intention recognizers do indeed prevail against the best-known successful strategies of iterated dilemmas of cooperation, even in the presence of errors and reduction of fitness associated with a small cognitive cost for performing intention recognition.","2012-10","2021-08-04 14:26:56","2021-08-04 14:26:56","2021-08-04 14:26:56","365-383","","4","18","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although researchers in the field of neuroevolution (NE) attempt to recapitulate this process, artificial neural networks (ANNs) so far evolved through NE algorithms do not match the distinctive capabilities of biological brains. The recently introduced hypercube-based neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (HyperNEAT) approach narrowed this gap by demonstrating that the pattern of weights across the connectivity of an ANN can be generated as a function of its geometry, thereby allowing large ANNs to be evolved for high-dimensional problems. Yet the positions and number of the neurons connected through this approach must be decided a priori by the user and, unlike in living brains, cannot change during evolution. Evolvable-substrate HyperNEAT (ES-HyperNEAT), introduced in this article, addresses this limitation by automatically deducing the node geometry from implicit information in the pattern of weights encoded by HyperNEAT, thereby avoiding the need to evolve explicit placement. This approach not only can evolve the location of every neuron in the network, but also can represent regions of varying density, which means resolution can increase holistically over evolution. ES-HyperNEAT is demonstrated through multi-task, maze navigation, and modular retina domains, revealing that the ANNs generated by this new approach assume natural properties such as neural topography and geometric regularity. Also importantly, ES-HyperNEAT's compact indirect encoding can be seeded to begin with a bias toward a desired class of ANN topographies, which facilitates the evolutionary search. The main conclusion is that ES-HyperNEAT significantly expands the scope of neural structures that evolution can discover.","2012-10","2021-08-04 14:26:47","2021-08-04 14:26:47","2021-08-04 14:26:47","331-363","","4","18","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\C7YC547P\Risi and Stanley - 2012 - An Enhanced Hypercube-Based Encoding for Evolving .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bacteria use QS to trigger secretion of digestive enzymes, formation and destruction of biofilms, and, in the case of pathogenic organisms, expression of virulence factors that cause disease. Investigations of mechanisms that prevent or disrupt QS, referred to as quorum quenching, are of interest because they provide a new alternative to antibiotics for treating bacterial infections. Traditional antibiotics either kill bacteria or inhibit their growth, producing selective pressures that promote resistant strains. In contrast, quorum quenching and other so-called anti-infective strategies focus on altering behavior. In this article we evolve QS in populations of digital organisms, a type of self-replicating computer program, and investigate the effects of quorum quenching on these populations. Specifically, we injected the populations with mutant organisms that were impaired in selected ways to disrupt the QS process. The experimental results indicate that the rate at which these mutants are introduced into a population influences both the evolvability of QS and the persistence of an existing QS behavior. Surprisingly, we also observed resistance to quorum quenching. Effectively, populations evolved resistance by reaching quorum at lower cell densities than did the parent strain. Moreover, the level of resistance was highest when the rate of mutant introduction increased over time. These results show that digital organisms can serve as a model to study the evolution and disruption of QS, potentially informing wet-lab studies aimed at identifying targets for anti-infective development.","2012-07","2021-08-04 14:26:20","2021-08-04 14:26:20","2021-08-04 14:26:20","291-310","","3","18","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\2GQ6J579\Beckmann et al. - 2012 - Evolution of Resistance to Quorum Quenching in Dig.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Other models for early evolution (e.g., by Dyson, Gánti, Varela, and Kauffman) invoke catalytic networks, where cross-catalysis is more apparent. A key question is how the balance between auto- (self-) and cross- (mutual) catalysis shapes the behavior of model evolving systems. This is investigated using the graded autocatalysis replication domain (GARD) model, previously shown to capture essential features of reproduction, mutation, and evolution in compositional molecular assemblies. We have performed numerical simulations of an ensemble of GARD networks, each with a different set of lognormally distributed catalytic values. We asked what is the influence of the catalytic content of such networks on beneficial evolution. Importantly, a clear trend was observed, wherein only networks with high mutual catalysis propensity (p               mc               ) allowed for an augmented diversity of composomes, quasi-stationary compositions that exhibit high replication fidelity. We have reexamined a recent analysis that showed meager selection in a single GARD instance and for a few nonstationary target compositions. In contrast, when we focused here on compotypes (clusters of composomes) as targets for selection in populations of compositional assemblies, appreciable selection response was observed for a large portion of the networks simulated. Further, stronger selection response was seen for high p               mc               values. Our simulations thus demonstrate that GARD can help analyze important facets of evolving systems, and indicate that excess mutual catalysis over self-catalysis is likely to be important for the emergence of molecular systems capable of evolutionlike behavior.","2012-07","2021-08-04 14:26:03","2021-08-04 14:26:03","2021-08-04 14:26:03","243-266","","3","18","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, studying the evolution of ecological communities under traditional modeling approaches based on differential calculus requires species' characteristics to be predefined, which limits the generality of the results. An alternative but less standardized methodology relies on intensive computer simulation of evolving communities made of simple, explicitly described individuals. We study here the formation, evolution, and diversity dynamics of a community of virtual plants with a novel individual-centered model involving three different scales: the genetic, the developmental, and the physiological scales. It constitutes an original attempt at combining development, evolution, and population dynamics (based on multi-agent interactions) into one comprehensive, yet simple model. In this world, we observe that our simulated plants evolve increasingly elaborate canopies, which are capable of intercepting ever greater amounts of light. Generated morphologies vary from the simplest one-branch structure of promoter plants to a complex arborization of several hundred thousand branches in highly evolved variants. On the population scale, the heterogeneous spatial structuration of the plant community at each generation depends solely on the evolution of its component plants. Using this virtual data, the morphologies and the dynamics of diversity production were analyzed by various statistical methods, based on genotypic and phenotypic distance metrics. The results demonstrate that diversity can spontaneously emerge in a community of mutually interacting individuals under the influence of specific environmental conditions.","2012-04","2021-08-04 14:25:33","2021-08-04 14:25:33","2021-08-04 14:25:33","199-222","","2","18","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\J4EBRUN3\Fernández et al. - 2012 - Emergent Diversity in an Open-Ended Evolving Virtu.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The performance of AHHS controllers is compared with neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT) in the coupled inverted pendulums benchmark.

We analyze the evolved controllers with regard to the usage of sensory inputs and the emerging oscillations, and we give a nonlinear dynamics interpretation.

Template replication is the solution found by nature. A scalable device must also be capable of miniaturization, and so have few or no moving and electronic parts. Here a significant step toward this goal is presented in the form of a physical template replicator made from small plastic pieces containing embedded magnets that float on an air-hockey-type table and undergo stochastic motion. Our units replicate by a process analogous to the replication of DNA, except without the involvement of enzymes. Building a physical rather than a computational model forces us to confront several problems that have analogues on the nano scale. In particular, replication must be maintained by preventing side reactions such as spontaneous ligation, cyclization, product inhibition, and elongation at staggered ends.

The thesis of this article is that living technology is not just one more technology; rather, it is the perfection of technology as understood by Aristotle. Aristotle's thinking is in this way a key example of a profound reassessment of nature and technology.

Could the vision of harnessing life be realized, which we strongly doubt, living technology would give selected humans transforming powers that could be expected to exacerbate, rather than solve, current global problems. The source of human purposefulness, and hence of both technology and ethics, is identified in nature's emergent capability to instantiate informational representations in material forms. Ethics that are properly grounded in an appreciation of intrinsic value, especially that of life, demand that proposals to give humanity the capabilities of living technology address the social, political, economic, and environmental problems inherent in its development and potential deployment.

As a result the bio-debate is no longer dominated by biotechnology, but driven by NBIC convergence. NBIC convergence enables two bioengineering megatrends: “biology becoming technology” and “technology becoming biology.” The notion of living technologies captures the latter megatrend. Accordingly, living technology presents a politically and ethically sensitive area. This implies that governments sooner or later are faced with the challenge of both promoting and regulating the development of living technology. This article describes four current political models to deal with innovation promotion and risk regulation. Based on two specific developments in the field of living technologies—(psycho)physiological computing and synthetic biology—we reflect on appropriate governance strategies for living technologies. We conclude that recent pleas for anticipatory and deliberative governance tend to neglect the need for anticipatory regulation as a key factor in guiding the development of the life sciences from a societal perspective. In particular, when it is expected that a certain living technology will radically challenge current regulatory systems, one should opt for just such a more active biopolitical approach.","2013-10","2021-08-04 14:23:11","2021-08-04 14:23:11","2021-08-04 14:23:11","437-450","","3_4","19","","Artificial Life","Governance Strategies for Living Technologies","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The environment offers people ways to interact with it, which we call affordances. Living technology is a design for new affordances. When we experience something new, we remember it by the way we perceive and interact with it. Recent studies in neuroscience have led to the idea of a default mode network, which is a baseline activity of a brain system. The autonomy of artificial life must be understood as a sort of default mode that self-organizes its baseline activity, preparing for its external inputs and its interaction with humans. I thus propose a method for creating a suitable default mode as a design principle for living technology. I built a machine called the mind time machine (MTM), which runs continuously for 10 h per day and receives visual data from its environment using 15 video cameras. The MTM receives and edits the video inputs while it self-organizes the momentary now. Its base program is a neural network that includes chaotic dynamics inside the system and a meta-network that consists of video feedback systems. Using this system as the hardware and a default mode network as a conceptual framework, I describe the system's autonomous behavior. Using the MTM as a testing ground, I propose a design principle for living technology.","2013-10","2021-08-04 14:22:53","2021-08-04 14:22:53","2021-08-04 14:22:53","387-400","","3_4","19","","Artificial Life","A Design for Living Technology","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inspired by the study of a range of biological systems, we propose that degeneracy—the realization of multiple, functionally versatile components with contextually overlapping functional redundancy—will support adaptation in technologies, because it effects pervasive flexibility, evolutionary innovation, and homeostatic robustness.

We present Bütschli water-in-oil droplets as a model for further investigation into the development of a technology with living properties. Otto Bütschli first described the system in 1898, when he used alkaline water droplets in olive oil to initiate a saponification reaction. This simple recipe produced structures that moved and exhibited characteristics that resembled, at least superficially, the amoeba. We reconstructed the Bütschli system and observed its life span under a light microscope, observing chemical patterns and droplet behaviors in nearly three hundred replicate experiments. Self-organizing patterns were observed, and during this dynamic, embodied phase the droplets provided a means of introducing temporal and spatial order in the system with the potential for chemical programmability. The authors propose that the discrete formation of dynamic droplets, characterized by their lifelike behavior patterns, during a variable window of time (from 30 s to 30 min after the addition of alkaline water to the oil phase), qualify this system as an example of living technology. The analysis of the Bütschli droplets suggests that a set of conditions may precede the emergence of lifelike characteristics and exemplifies the richness of this rudimentary chemical system, not only for artificial life investigations but also for possible real-world applications in architectural practice.","2013-10","2021-08-04 14:22:32","2021-08-04 14:22:32","2021-08-04 14:22:32","331-346","","3_4","19","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When the graph's nodes stand for the possible solutions to certain problems of combinatorial optimization, choosing its edges appropriately has been shown to lead to conduciveness properties that provide useful insight into the performance of algorithms to solve those problems. Here we study the conduciveness of CA-rule graphs, that is, graphs whose node set is the set of all CA rules given a cell's number of possible states and neighborhood size. We consider several different edge sets interconnecting these nodes, both deterministic and random ones, and derive analytical expressions for the resulting graph's conduciveness toward rules having a fixed number of non-quiescent entries. We demonstrate that one of the random edge sets, characterized by allowing nodes to be sparsely interconnected across any Hamming distance between the corresponding rules, has the potential of providing reasonable conduciveness toward the desired rules.

These behaviors are relevant not only for the biologist but also for the engineer interested in decentralized collective robotics. We address these phenomena by carrying out experiments with groups of two simulated robots controlled by neural networks whose connection weights are evolved by using genetic algorithms. These algorithms and controllers are well suited to autonomously find solutions for decentralized collective robotic tasks based on principles of self-organization. The article first presents a taxonomy of role-taking and specialization mechanisms related to evolved neural network controllers. Then it introduces two cooperation tasks, which can be accomplished by either role taking or specialization, and uses these tasks to compare four different genetic algorithms to evaluate their capacity to evolve a suitable behavioral strategy, which depends on the task demands. Interestingly, only one of the four algorithms, which appears to have more biological plausibility, is capable of evolving role taking or specialization when they are needed. The results are relevant for both collective robotics and biology, as they can provide useful hints on the different processes that can lead to the emergence of specialization in robots and organisms.","2013-04","2021-08-04 14:20:59","2021-08-04 14:20:59","2021-08-04 14:20:59","221-253","","2","19","","Artificial Life","Different Genetic Algorithms and the Evolution of Specialization","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because of this strong coupling, most of the impressive applications in morphological computation typically apply minimalistic control architectures. Ideally, adapting the morphology of the plant and optimizing the control law interact so that finally, optimal physical properties of the system and optimal control laws emerge. As a first step toward this vision, we apply optimal control methods for investigating the power of morphological computation. We use a probabilistic optimal control method to acquire control laws, given the current morphology. We show that by changing the morphology of our robot, control problems can be simplified, resulting in optimal controllers with reduced complexity and higher performance.

We developed a simplified physics model of these robots, and through experiments in simulation and real-world robotic platforms, we show three distinctive mechanisms for generating different gait patterns in these robots.","2013-01","2021-08-04 14:19:42","2021-08-04 14:19:42","2021-08-04 14:19:42","97-114","","1","19","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study reports on self-organized behavior in which distributed centimeter-sized modules stochastically aggregate and exhibit a translational wheeling motion. The system consists of two types of centimeter-sized water-floating modules: a triangular-shaped module that is equipped with a vibration motor and a permanent magnet (termed the active module), which can quasi-randomly rove around; and circular modules that are equipped with permanent magnets (termed passive modules). In its quasi-random movement in water, the active module picks up passive modules through magnetic attraction. The contacts between the modules induce a torque transfer from the active module to the passive modules. This results in rotational motion of the passive modules. As a consequence of the shape difference between the triangular module and the circular module, the passive modules rotate like wheels, being kept on the same edges as the active module. The motion of the active module is examined, as well as the characteristics and behavior of the self-organization process.","2013-01","2021-08-04 14:19:37","2021-08-04 14:19:37","2021-08-04 14:19:37","79-95","","1","19","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\XCZ7UUGY\Miyashita et al. - 2013 - Self-Organized Translational Wheeling Motion in St.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goals of this research include understanding how living systems exhibit behavioral diversity and using these findings to build lifelike robots that exhibit truly adaptive behaviors. To this end, we have focused on one of the most primitive forms of intelligence concerning behavioral diversity, namely, a plasmodium of true slime mold. The plasmodium is a large amoeba-like unicellular organism that does not possess any nervous system or specialized organs. However, it exhibits versatile spatiotemporal oscillatory patterns and switches spontaneously between these. Inspired by the plasmodium, we built a mathematical model that exhibits versatile oscillatory patterns and spontaneously transitions between these patterns. This model demonstrates that, in contrast to coupled nonlinear oscillators with a well-designed complex diffusion network, physically interacting mechanosensory oscillators are capable of generating versatile oscillatory patterns without changing any parameters. Thus, the results are expected to shed new light on the design scheme for lifelike robots that exhibit amazingly versatile and adaptive behaviors.","2013-01","2021-08-04 14:19:31","2021-08-04 14:19:31","2021-08-04 14:19:31","67-78","","1","19","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent work has linked this to the field of reservoir computing, allowing one to endow morphologies with a theory of universal computation. In this work, we study a family of highly dynamic body structures, called tensegrity structures, controlled by one of the simplest kinds of “brains.” These structures can be used to model biomechanical systems at different scales. By analyzing this extreme instantiation of compliant structures, we demonstrate the existence of a spectrum of choices of how to implement control in the body-brain composite.

The corresponding binary genome format is compatible with gene deletion, duplication, and recombination. In the simulation presented here, an agent consisting of two UMs, a sender and a receiver, must encode, transmit, and decode a binary word over time using the narrow communication channel between them. This communication problem has chicken-and-egg structure in that a sending mechanism is useless without a corresponding receiving mechanism. An in-depth case study reveals that a coincidence creates a minimal partial solution, from which a sequence of partial sending and receiving mechanisms evolve. Gene duplications contribute by enlarging the regulatory network. Analysis of 60,000 sample runs under a variety of parameter settings confirms that crossover accelerates evolution, that stronger selection tends to find clumsier solutions and finds them more slowly, and that there is implicit selection for robust mechanisms and genomes at the codon level. Typical solutions associate each input bit with an activation speed and combine them almost additively. The parents of breakthrough organisms sometimes have lower fitness scores than others in the population, indicating that populations can cross valleys in the fitness landscape via outlying members. The simulation exhibits back mutations and population-level memory effects not accounted for in traditional population genetics models. All together, these phenomena suggest that new evolutionary models are needed that incorporate regulatory network structure.","2014-10","2021-08-04 13:16:51","2021-08-04 13:16:51","2021-08-04 13:16:51","491-530","","4","20","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We depict a coordination problem that is part of the more general structure of intermittent adaptation: the adjustment-deployment dilemma. It captures the intricate compromise between the time spent in adjusting a response and the time used to deploy it: The adjustment process improves fitness with time, but during deployment fitness of the solution decays as environmental conditions change. We provide a formal characterization of the dilemma, and solve it using computational methods. We find that the optimal solution always results in a high intermittency between adjustment and deployment around a non-maximal fitness value. Furthermore we show that this non-maximal fitness value is directly determined by the ratio between the exponential coefficient of the fitness increase during adjustment and that of its decay coefficient during deployment. We compare the model results with experimental data obtained from observation and measurement of intermittent behavior in animals. Among other phenomena, the model is able to predict the uneven distribution of average duration of search and motion phases found among various species such as fishes, birds, and lizards. Despite the complexity of the problem, it can be shown to be solved by relatively simple mechanisms. We find that a model of a single continuous-time recurrent neuron, with the same parametric configuration, is capable of solving the dilemma for a wide set of conditions. We finally hypothesize that many of the different patterns of intermittent behavior found in nature might respond to optimal solutions of complexified versions of the adjustment-deployment dilemma under different constraints.","2014-10","2021-08-04 13:16:44","2021-08-04 13:16:44","2021-08-04 13:16:44","471-489","","4","20","","Artificial Life","Intermittent Animal Behavior","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we adopt methods from evolutionary biology to analyze a simple, yet representative, genetic programming method, linear genetic programming. We demonstrate that recombination has less disruptive effects on phenotype than mutation, that it accelerates novel phenotypic exploration, and that it particularly promotes robust phenotypes and evolves genotypic robustness and synergistic epistasis.

Our primary biological example is the self-assembly of icosahedral viruses; our synthetic example is surface-tension-driven self-folding polyhedra. In both instances, the process of self-assembly is modeled by decomposing the polyhedron into a set of partially formed intermediate states. The set of all intermediates is called the configuration space, pathways of assembly are modeled as paths in the configuration space, and the kinetics and yield of assembly are modeled by rate equations, Markov chains, or cost functions on the configuration space. We review an interesting interplay between biological function and mathematical structure in viruses in light of this framework. We discuss in particular: (i) tiling theory as a coarse-grained description of all-atom models; (ii) the building game—a growth model for the formation of polyhedra; and (iii) the application of these models to the self-assembly of the bacteriophage MS2. We then use a similar framework to model self-folding polyhedra. We use a discrete folding algorithm to compute a configuration space that idealizes surface-tension-driven self-folding and analyze pathways of assembly and dominant intermediates. These computations are then compared with experimental observations of a self-folding dodecahedron with side 300 μm. In both models, despite a combinatorial explosion in the size of the configuration space, a few pathways and intermediates dominate self-assembly. For self-folding polyhedra, the dominant intermediates have fewer degrees of freedom than comparable intermediates, and are thus more rigid. The concentration of assembly pathways on a few intermediates with distinguished geometric properties is biologically and physically important, and suggests deeper mathematical structure.","2014-10","2021-08-04 13:16:21","2021-08-04 13:16:21","2021-08-04 13:16:21","409-439","","4","20","","Artificial Life","Building Polyhedra by Self-Assembly","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Under this scaling, linguistic conventions can efficiently emerge and widely diffuse among individuals, thus maintaining a useful level of mutual understandability even in a big population. From an evolutionary perspective, we regard this social optimality as a tradeoff among social scaling, mutual understandability, and population growth. Empirical evidence confirms that such optimal power laws exist in many large-scale social systems that are constructed primarily via language-related interactions.

A system with such a capability is potentially adaptable to perform complicated tasks with proper parameterizations and may successfully reach the solution space of behaviors from the point of view of search and evolutionary algorithms. This article aims to take an early step toward exploring this capability at the levels of individuals and populations by introducing measures of diversity generation and by evaluating the influence of different types of processes on diversity generation. A reaction-diffusion-based controller called the artificial homeostatic hormone system (AHHS) is studied as a system consisting of different processes with various domains of functioning (e.g., internal or external to the control unit). Various combinations of these processes are investigated in terms of diversity generation at levels of both individuals and populations, and the effects of the processes are discussed representing different influences for the processes.

Task partitioning is the decomposition of a task into subtasks that can be tackled by different workers. We focus on the case in which a task is partitioned into a sequence of subtasks that must be executed in a certain order. This implies that the subtasks must interface with each other, and that the output of a subtask is used as input for the subtask that follows. A distinction can be made between task partitioning with direct transfer and with indirect transfer. We focus our study on the first case: The output of a subtask is directly transferred from an individual working on that subtask to an individual working on the subtask that follows. As a test bed for our study, we use a swarm of robots performing foraging. The robots have to harvest objects from a source, situated in an unknown location, and transport them to a home location. When a robot finds the source, it memorizes its position and uses dead reckoning to return there. Dead reckoning is appealing in robotics, since it is a cheap localization method and it does not require any additional external infrastructure. However, dead reckoning leads to errors that grow in time if not corrected periodically. We compare a foraging strategy that does not make use of task partitioning with one that does. We show that cooperation through task partitioning can be used to limit the effect of dead reckoning errors. This results in improved capability of locating the object source and in increased performance of the swarm. We use the implemented system as a test bed to study benefits and costs of task partitioning with direct transfer. We implement the system with real robots, demonstrating the feasibility of our approach in a foraging scenario.","2014-07","2021-08-04 13:15:17","2021-08-04 13:15:17","2021-08-04 13:15:17","291-317","","3","20","","Artificial Life","Task Partitioning in a Robot Swarm","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Artificial ecosystems have many features in common with ecological or economic systems, but surprisingly the method does not appear to have been very successful in this field of application. The hypothesis of this article is that this failure is due to the incorrect interpretation of the method's concepts and mathematical tools. We propose to review and reinterpret the method so that it can be correctly applied and all its potential exploited in order to study and characterize the global behavior of an artificial multi-agent ecosystem.","2014-04","2021-08-04 13:15:03","2021-08-04 13:15:03","2021-08-04 13:15:03","237-270","","2","20","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the real world, individuals face an ecology of games where they play many such games simultaneously, often with overlapping co-players. Here, we study an agent-based model of an ecology of public goods games and compare the effectiveness of two institutional mechanisms for promoting cooperation: a simple institution of limited group size (capacity constraints) and a reputational institution based on observed behavior. Reputation is shown to allow much higher relative payoffs for cooperators than do capacity constraints, but only if (1) the rate of reputational information flow is fast enough relative to the rate of social mobility, and (2) cooperators are relatively common in the population. When these conditions are not met, capacity constraints are more effective at protecting the interests of cooperators. Because of the simplicity of the limited-group-size rule, capacity constraints can also generate social organization, which promotes cooperation much more quickly than can reputation. Our results are discussed in terms of both normative prescriptions and evolutionary theory regarding institutions that regulate cooperation. More broadly, the ecology-of-games approach developed here provides an adaptable modeling framework for studying a wide variety of problems in the social sciences.","2014-04","2021-08-04 13:14:39","2021-08-04 13:14:39","2021-08-04 13:14:39","207-221","","2","20","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From a glider's reaction to each nondestructive perturbation, its cognitive domain is then mapped. In addition, the structure of a glider's possible knowledge of its immediate environment, and the way in which that knowledge is grounded in its constitution, are fully described. The notion of structural coupling is then explored by characterizing the paths of mutual perturbation that a glider and its environment can undergo.

They tend to evaluate and select all individuals on the same part of the task, which leads to genetic convergence within the population. The goal of evolutionary niching methods is to enforce diversity in the population so that this genetic convergence is avoided. One drawback with some of these niching methods is that they require a priori knowledge or assumptions about the specific fitness landscape in order to work; another is that many such methods are not set up to work on cooperative tasks where fitness is only relevant at the group level. Here we address these problems by presenting the group GA, described earlier by the authors, which is a group-based evolutionary algorithm that can lead to emergent niching. After demonstrating the group GA on an immune system matching task, we extend the previous work and present two modified versions where the number of niches does not need to be specified ahead of time. In the random-group-size GA, the number of niches is varied randomly during evolution, and in the evolved-group-size GA the number of niches is optimized by evolution.

This problem is compounded by the high degree of coupling between the material properties of a soft body (such as stiffness or damping coefficients) and the effectiveness of a gait. This article synthesizes four years of research into soft robotics, in particular describing three approaches to the co-discovery of soft robot morphology and control. In the first, muscle placement and firing patterns are coevolved for a fixed body shape with fixed material properties. In the second, the material properties of a simulated soft body coevolve alongside locomotive gaits, with body shape and muscle placement fixed. In the third, a developmental encoding is used to scalably grow elaborate soft body shapes from a small seed structure.

We use a generalized stochastic Petri net view of the robot team controlled by the institutional controllers to model and analyze the stochastic performance of the resulting distributed robotic system. The ability of our formalism to replicate results obtained using other approaches is assessed through realistic simulations of up to 40 e-puck robots.

This region encodes an input-output function, referred to as signal-integration logic, that maps a specific combination of regulatory signals (inputs) to a particular expression state (output) of a gene. The space of all possible signal-integration functions is vast and the mapping from input to output is many-to-one: For the same set of inputs, many functions (genotypes) yield the same expression output (phenotype). Here, we exhaustively enumerate the set of signal-integration functions that yield identical gene expression patterns within a computational model of gene regulatory circuits. Our goal is to characterize the relationship between robustness and evolvability in the signal-integration space of regulatory circuits, and to understand how these properties vary between the genotypic and phenotypic scales. Among other results, we find that the distributions of genotypic robustness are skewed, so that the majority of signal-integration functions are robust to perturbation. We show that the connected set of genotypes that make up a given phenotype are constrained to specific regions of the space of all possible signal-integration functions, but that as the distance between genotypes increases, so does their capacity for unique innovations. In addition, we find that robust phenotypes are (i) evolvable, (ii) easily identified by random mutation, and (iii) mutationally biased toward other robust phenotypes. We explore the implications of these latter observations for mutation-based evolution by conducting random walks between randomly chosen source and target phenotypes. We demonstrate that the time required to identify the target phenotype is independent of the properties of the source phenotype.","2014-01","2021-08-04 13:13:23","2021-08-04 13:13:23","2021-08-04 13:13:23","111-126","","1","20","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\I89TLG9U\Payne et al. - 2014 - Robustness, Evolvability, and the Logic of Genetic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In swarm systems most of the observed complexity is based on motion of simple entities. Similarly, statistical mechanics focuses on collective properties induced by the motion of many interacting particles. In this article we apply methods from statistical mechanics to swarm systems. We try to explain the emergent behavior of a simulated swarm by applying methods based on the fluctuation theorem. Empirical results indicate that swarms are able to produce negative entropy within an isolated subsystem due to frozen accidents. Individuals of a swarm are able to locally detect fluctuations of the global entropy measure and store them, if they are negative entropy productions. By accumulating these stored fluctuations over time the swarm as a whole is producing negative entropy and the system ends up in an ordered state. We claim that this indicates the existence of an inverted fluctuation theorem for emergent self-organizing dissipative systems. This approach bears the potential of general applicability.","2014-01","2021-08-04 13:13:06","2021-08-04 13:13:06","2021-08-04 13:13:06","77-93","","1","20","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\CV3EKB5Q\Hamann et al. - 2014 - Analysis of Swarm Behaviors Based on an Inversion .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We contribute to the maturation of this more inclusive approach by highlighting some problematic assumptions that still lead to an ximpoverished conception of the phenomenon of life. In particular, we argue that the new consensus has so far failed to consider the relevance of intermediate time scales. We propose that an adequate theory of life must account for the fact that all living beings are situated in at least four distinct time scales, which are typically associated with metabolism, motility, development, and evolution. In this view, self-movement, adaptive behavior, and morphological changes could have already been present at the origin of life. In order to illustrate this possibility, we analyze a minimal model of lifelike phenomena, namely, of precarious, individuated, dissipative structures that can be found in simple reaction-diffusion systems. Based on our analysis, we suggest that processes on intermediate time scales could have already been operative in prebiotic systems. They may have facilitated and constrained changes occurring in the faster- and slower-paced time scales of chemical self-individuation and evolution by natural selection, respectively.","2014-01","2021-08-04 13:13:00","2021-08-04 13:13:00","2021-08-04 13:12:59","55-76","","1","20","","Artificial Life","Motility at the Origin of Life","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\TCIH2R66\Froese et al. - 2014 - Motility at the Origin of Life Its Characterizati.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The method of staging divides the self-assembly process into time intervals, during which components can be added to, or removed from, an environment at each interval. Staging addresses the challenge of using components that lack plasticity by encoding the construction of a target structure in the staging algorithm itself and not exclusively in the design of the components. Previous staging strategies do not consider the interplay between component physical features (morphological information). In this work we use morphological information to stage the self-assembly process, during which components can only be added to their environment at each time interval, to demonstrate our concept. Four experiments are presented, which use heterogeneous, passive, mechanical components that are fabricated using 3D printing. Two orbital shaking environments are used to provide energy to the components and to investigate the role of morphological information with component movement in either two or three spatial dimensions. The benefit of our staging strategy is shown by reducing assembly errors and exploiting bonding mechanisms with rotational properties. As well, a doglike target structure is used to demonstrate in theory how component information used at an earlier time interval can be reused at a later time interval, inspired by the use of a body plan in biological development. We propose that a staged body plan is one method toward scaling self-assembling systems with many interacting components. The experiments and body plan example demonstrate, as proof of concept, that staging enables the self-assembly of more complex morphologies not otherwise possible.","2014-01","2021-08-04 13:12:48","2021-08-04 13:12:48","2021-08-04 13:12:48","29-53","","1","20","","Artificial Life","Staging the Self-Assembly Process","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the obvious importance of genetic modules, the mechanisms by which they form and persist are not understood. One clue is that functionally related genes tend to cluster together. Here we show that genetic translocation, recombination, and natural selection play a central role in this process. We distill the question of emerging genetic modularity into three simulation experiments that show: (1) a tendency, under natural selection, for essential genes to co-locate on the same chromosome and to settle in fixed loci; (2) that genes associated with a particular function tend to form functional clusters; and (3) that genes within a functional cluster tend to become arranged in transcription order.

This article first demonstrates that this artificial chemistry is computationally universal if it has only rules that have one reactant or two reactants. We think this is a good property of an artificial chemistry that models molecular computing, because natural elementary chemical reactions, on which molecular computing is based, are mostly unimolecular or bimolecular. Then we give two illustrative example models for DNA computing in our artificial chemistry: one is for the type of computation called the Adleman-Lipton paradigm, and the other is for a DNA implementation of a finite automaton. Through the construction of these models we observe preferred properties of the artificial chemistry for modeling molecular computing, such as having no spatial structure and being flexible in choosing levels of abstraction.","2007-07","2021-08-04 15:01:32","2021-08-04 15:01:32","2021-08-04 15:01:32","223-247","","3","13","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These models describe the coupled growth of the lipid container and of the self-replicating molecules. A technique to analyze the dynamics of populations of such protocells is described, which couples a continuous-time formalism for the growth between two successive cell divisions, and a discrete map that relates the quantity of self-replicating molecules in successive generations. This technique allows one to derive several properties in an analytical way. It is shown that, under fairly general assumptions, the two growth rates synchronize, so that the lipid container doubles its size when the number of self-replicating molecules has also doubled—thus giving rise to exponential growth of the population of protocells. Such synchronization had been postulated a priori in previous models of protocells; here it is an emergent property. We also compare the rate of duplication of two populations generated by two different protocells with different kinds of self-replicating molecules, considering the interesting case where the rate of self-replication of one kind is higher than that of the other, but its contribution to the container growth rate is smaller. It is shown that in this case the population of offspring of the protocell with the faster-replicating molecule will eventually grow faster than the other. The case where two different types of self-replicating monomers are present in the same protocell is also analyzed, and it is shown that, if the replication follows a first-order kinetic equation, then the faster replicator eventually displaces the slower one, whereas if the growth is sublinear the two coexist. It is also proven by an appropriate rescaling of time that the results that concern the system asymptotic dynamics hold both for micelles and vesicles.","2007-04","2021-08-04 14:59:48","2021-08-04 14:59:48","2021-08-04 14:59:48","123-138","","2","13","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A synthetic vision system is proposed to tackle the problem of collision recognition in dynamic environments. The system combines the outputs of four whole-field motion-detecting neurons, each receiving inputs from a network of neurons employing asymmetric lateral inhibition to suppress their responses to one direction of motion. An evolutionary algorithm is then used to adjust the weights between the four motion-detecting neurons to tune the system to detect collisions in two test environments. To do this, a population of agents, each representing a proposed synthetic visual system, either were shown images generated by a mobile Khepera robot navigating in a simplified laboratory environment or were shown images videoed outdoors from a moving vehicle. The agents had to cope with the local environment correctly in order to survive. After 400 generations, the best agent recognized imminent collisions reliably in the familiar environment where it had evolved. However, when the environment was swapped, only the agent evolved to cope in the robotic environment still signaled collision reliably. This study suggests that whole-field direction-selective neurons, with selectivity based on asymmetric lateral inhibition, can be organized into a synthetic vision system, which can then be adapted to play an important role in collision detection in complex dynamic scenes.","2007-04","2021-08-04 14:59:41","2021-08-04 14:59:41","2021-08-04 14:59:41","93-122","","2","13","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cultural learning describes the process of information transfer between individuals in a population through non-genetic means. Cultural learning has been simulated by combining genetic algorithms and neural networks using a teacher-pupil scenario where highly fit individuals are selected as teachers and instruct the next generation. By examining the innate fitness of a population (i.e., the fitness of the population measured before any cultural learning takes place), it is possible to examine the effects of cultural learning on the population's genetic makeup. Our model explores the effect of cultural learning on a population and employs three benchmark sequential decision tasks as the evolutionary task for the population: connect-four, tic-tac-toe, and blackjack. Experiments are conducted with populations employing population learning alone and populations combining population and cultural learning. The article presents results showing the gradual transfer of knowledge from genes to the cultural process, illustrated by the simultaneous decrease in the population's innate fitness and the increase of its acquired fitness measured after learning takes place.","2007-01","2021-08-04 14:59:16","2021-08-04 14:59:16","2021-08-04 14:59:16","45-67","","1","13","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is known about the dynamic evolution of these balances in complex environments. Our purpose is to give a new insight into the benefit and cost of learning by focusing on the quantitative evolution of phenotypic plasticity under the assumption of epistatic interactions. For this purpose, we have constructed an evolutionary model of quantitative traits by using an extended version of Kauffman's NK fitness landscape. Phenotypic plasticity is introduced into our model; whether each phenotype is plastic or not is genetically defined, and plastic phenotypes can be adjusted by learning. The simulation results clearly show that drastic changes in roles of learning cause three-step evolution through the Baldwin effect and also cause the evolution of genetic robustness against mutations. We also conceptualize four different roles of learning by using a hill-climbing image of a population on a fitness landscape.","2007-01","2021-08-04 14:59:02","2021-08-04 14:59:02","2021-08-04 14:59:02","31-43","","1","13","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Altruistic traits, which reduce the absolute fitness of their bearers, cannot evolve without positive assortment (excess segregation). The question of how positive assortment can arise has been controversial, but most evolutionary biologists believe that common descent is the only effective general mechanism. Here I investigate another recently proposed mechanism for generating nonrandom assortment, termed environmental feedback. This requires only that two forms of a trait affect the quality of the local environment differently in such a way that all individuals are more likely to leave low-quality locales. Experiments with simple computational models confirm that environmental feedback generates significant levels of genetic similarity among non-kin within locales. The mechanism is fairly general, and can under some conditions produce levels of genetic similarity comparable to those resulting from close genealogical relationship. Environmental feedback can also generate the negative assortment necessary for the evolution of spiteful traits. Environmental feedback is expected to create positive frequency-dependent selection, which thus favor any social trait that becomes common in the population. Results from this stylized model suggest that environmental feedback could be important in the evolution of both cooperation and spite, within as well as between species.","2007-01","2021-08-04 14:58:48","2021-08-04 14:58:48","2021-08-04 14:58:48","1-9","","1","13","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We suggest that the existence of self-organizing aggregations provides a mechanism by which aggregation behavior can evolve. The inclusion of an explicitly coded third behavior, aggregation, in a simulated population produces patterns statistically similar to those found on real rocky shores. Allowing these three behaviors to evolve using an evolutionary algorithm, however, results in aggregation behavior being selected against on shores with high crevice density. The inclusion of broadcast spawning dispersal mechanisms in the simulation, however, results in aggregation behavior evolving as predicted on shores with both high crevice density and low crevice density (evolving in crevices first, and then both in crevices and on flat rock), indicating the importance of environmental interactions in understanding evolutionary processes.

Pulses of wave fragments are injected into the checkerboard grid, resulting in rich spatiotemporal behavior, and a learning classifier system is shown to be able to direct the fragments to an arbitrary position through dynamic control of the light intensity within each cell in both simulated and real chemical systems. Similarly, a learning classifier system is shown to be able to control the electrical stimulation of cultured neuronal networks so that they display elementary learning. Results indicate that the learned stimulation protocols identify seemingly fundamental properties of in vitro neuronal networks. Use of another learning scheme presented in the literature confirms that such fundamental behavioral characteristics of a given network must be considered in training experiments.","2008-04","2021-08-04 14:55:59","2021-08-04 14:55:59","2021-08-04 14:55:59","203-222","","2","14","","Artificial Life","Towards Unconventional Computing through Simulated Evolution","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\7BBT27WH\Bull et al. - 2008 - Towards Unconventional Computing through Simulated.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We introduce and investigate a minimal photodriven metabolic system, which is based on photofragmentation of resource molecules catalyzed by genetic molecules. We represent and analyze the full metabolic set of reaction-kinetic equations and, through a set of approximations, simplify the reaction kinetics so that analytical expressions can be obtained for the building block production. The analytical approximations are compared with the full equation set and with corresponding experimental results to the extent they are available. It should be noted, however, that the proposed metabolic system has not been experimentally implemented, so this investigation is conducted to obtain a deeper understanding of its dynamics and perhaps to anticipate its limitations. We demonstrate that this type of minimal photodriven metabolic scheme is typically rate-limited by the front-end photoexcitation process, while its yield is determined by the genetic catalysis. We further predict that gene-catalyzed metabolic reactions can undergo evolutionary selection only for certain combinations of the involved reaction rates due to their intricate interactions. We finally discuss how the expected range of metabolic rates likely affects other key protocellular processes such as container growth and division as well as gene replication.","2008-04","2021-08-04 14:55:52","2021-08-04 14:55:52","2021-08-04 14:55:52","189-201","","2","14","","Artificial Life","Metabolic Photofragmentation Kinetics for a Minimal Protocell","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, the two morphologically identical robots should take care of obstacle avoidance; the other one should take care of phototaxis. Since all of the agents can emit and perceive sound, the group's coordination of actions is based on acoustic communication. The results of this study are a proof of concept: They show that dynamic artificial neural networks can be successfully synthesized by artificial evolution to design the neural mechanisms required to underpin the behavioral strategies and adaptive communication capabilities demanded by this task.

In higher multicellular organisms, signal selection and multiplexing are performed at the cis-regulatory domains of genes, where combinations of transcription factors (TFs) regulate the rates at which the genes are transcribed into mRNA. To be able to act as activators or repressors of gene transcription, TFs must first bind to target sequences on the regulatory domains. Two TFs that act in concert may bind entirely independently of each other, but more often binding of the first one will alter the affinity of the other for its binding site. This article presents a systematic investigation into the effect of TF binding dependences on the predicted regulatory function of this bio-logic. Four extreme scenarios, commonly used to classify enzyme activation and inhibition patterns, for the binding of two TFs were explored: independent (the TFs bind without affecting each other's affinities), competitive (the TFs compete for the same binding site), ordered (the TFs bind in a compulsory order), and joint binding (the TFs either bind as a preformed complex, or binding of one is virtually impossible in the absence of the other). The conclusions are: (1) the laws of combinatorial logic hold only for systems with independently binding TFs; (2) systems formed according to the other scenarios can mimic the functions of their Boolean logical counterparts, but cannot be combined or decomposed in the same way; and (3) the continuously scaled output of systems consisting of competitively binding activators and repressors can be controlled more robustly than that of single TF or (quasi-)logical multi-TF systems.","2008-01","2021-08-04 14:55:21","2021-08-04 14:55:21","2021-08-04 14:55:21","121-133","","1","14","","Artificial Life","Bio-Logic","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\79SN3VX8\Schilstra and Nehaniv - 2008 - Bio-Logic Gene Expression and the Laws of Combina.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

GRN models may differ in the evolvability of expressive regulatory dynamics. A new class of artificial GRNs with an evolvable number of complex cis-regulatory control sites—each involving a finite number of inhibitory and activatory binding factors—is introduced, allowing realization of complex regulatory logic. Previous work on biological clocks in nature has noted the capacity of clocks to oscillate in the absence of environmental stimuli, putting forth several candidate explanations for their observed behavior, related to anticipation of environmental conditions, compartmentation of activities in time, and robustness to perturbations of various kinds or to unselected accidents of neutral selection. Several of these hypotheses are explored by evolving GRNs with and without (Gaussian) noise and blackout periods for environmental stimulation. Robustness to certain types of perturbation appears to account for some, but not all, dynamical properties of the evolved networks. Unselected abilities, also observed for biological clocks, include the capacity to adapt to change in wavelength of environmental stimulus and to clock resetting.","2008-01","2021-08-04 14:55:14","2021-08-04 14:55:14","2021-08-04 14:55:14","135-148","","1","14","","Artificial Life","Genetic Regulatory Network Models of Biological Clocks","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present a model of the quorum sensing system in Vibrio fischeri using a variant of membrane systems called P systems. In this framework each bacterium and the environment are represented by membranes, and the rules are applied according to an extension of Gillespie's algorithm called the multicompartmental Gillespie's algorithm. This algorithm runs on more than one compartment and takes into account the disturbance produced when chemical substances diffuse from one compartment or region to another one. Our approach allows us to examine the individual behavior of each bacterium as an agent as well as the emergent behavior of the colony as a whole and the processes of swarming and recruitment. Our simulations show that at low cell densities bacteria remain dark, while at high cell densities some bacteria start to produce light and a recruitment process takes place that makes the whole colony of bacteria do so. Our computational modeling of quorum sensing could provide insights leading to new applications where multiple agents need to robustly and efficiently coordinate their collective behavior based only on very limited information about the local environment.","2008-01","2021-08-04 14:54:57","2021-08-04 14:54:57","2021-08-04 14:54:56","95-109","","1","14","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we implemented eight published models of the Drosophila circadian clock in Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) for comparative systems biology studies using E-Cell Simulation Environment version 3, to examine the system-level requirements for the clock mechanism to be robust, by calculating the period and amplitude sensitivity coefficients with simulation experiments. While all models were generally robust as determined by the network topology of the oscillatory feedback loop structure, existing models place relatively strong emphasis on transcription regulation, although this is a limitation on robustness.

On the other hand, fully realistic simulation is impracticable because of the extensive cost entailed and enormous amount of data required. Abstraction and modeling that balance the dual requirements of prediction accuracy and manageable calculation cost are of great importance for systems biology. We have constructed an ammonia metabolism model of the hepatic lobule, a histological component of the liver, based on a single-hepatocyte model that consists of the biochemical kinetics of enzymes and transporters. To bring the calculation cost within reason, the porto-central axis, which is an elemental structure of the lobule, is defined as the systems biological unit of the liver, and is accordingly modeled. A model including both histological structure and position-specific gene expression of major enzymes largely represents the physiological dynamics of the hepatic lobule in nature. In addition, heterogeneous gene expression is suggested to have evolved to optimize the energy efficiency of ammonia detoxification at the macroscopic level, implying that approaches like this may elucidate how properties at the molecular and cellular levels, such as regulated gene expression, modify higher-level phenomena of multicellular tissue, organs, and organisms.","2008-01","2021-08-04 14:54:15","2021-08-04 14:54:15","2021-08-04 14:54:15","3-28","","1","14","","Artificial Life","Construction of a Biological Tissue Model Based on a Single-Cell Model","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More specifically, we present a homogeneous control system that can achieve assembly between two modules (two fully autonomous robots) of a mobile self-reconfigurable system without a priori introduced behavioral or morphological heterogeneities. The controllers are dynamic neural networks evolved in simulation that directly control all the actuators of the two robots. The neurocontrollers cause the dynamic specialization of the robots by allocating roles between them based solely on their interaction. We show that the best evolved controller proves to be successful when tested on a real hardware platform, the swarm-bot. The performance achieved is similar to the one achieved by existing modular or behavior-based approaches, also due to the effect of an emergent recovery mechanism that was neither explicitly rewarded by the fitness function, nor observed during the evolutionary simulation. Our results suggest that direct access to the orientations or intentions of the other agents is not a necessary condition for robot coordination: Our robots coordinate without direct or explicit communication, contrary to what is assumed by most research works in collective robotics.

The FCM enables the agent to evaluate its environment (e.g., distance to predator or prey, distance to potential breeding partner, distance to food, energy level) and its internal states (e.g., fear, hunger, curiosity), and to choose several possible actions such as evasion, eating, or breeding. The FCM of each individual is unique and is the result of the evolutionary process. The notion of species is also implemented in such a way that species emerge from the evolving population of agents. To our knowledge, our system is the only one that allows the modeling of links between behavior patterns and speciation. The simulation produces a lot of data, including number of individuals, level of energy by individual, choice of action, age of the individuals, and average FCM associated with each species. This study investigates patterns of macroevolutionary processes, such as the emergence of species in a simulated ecosystem, and proposes a general framework for the study of specific ecological problems such as invasive species and species diversity patterns.

The study begins by simulating the evolution of simple artificial neural network systems that must learn quickly to perform well on simple classification tasks, and determining if and when extended periods of parental protection emerge. It is concluded that longer periods of parental protection of children do offer clear learning advantages and better adult performance, but only if procreation is not allowed during the protection period. In this case, a compromise protection period evolves that balances the improved learning performance against reduced procreation period. The crucial properties of the neural learning processes are then abstracted out to explore the possibility of studying the effect of learning more generally and with better computational efficiency.

This principally arises from their genetic networks. The processes governing transcription, translation, and gene regulation are well understood, as are the mechanisms of network evolution, such as gene duplication and horizontal gene transfer. However, the evolved networks arising from these simple processes are much more difficult to understand, and it is difficult to perform experiments on the evolution of these networks in living organisms because of the timescales involved. We propose a new framework for modeling and investigating the evolution of transcription networks in realistic, varied environments. The model we introduce contains novel, important, and lifelike features that allow the evolution of arbitrarily complex transcription networks. Molecular interactions are not specified; instead they are determined dynamically based on shape, allowing protein function to freely evolve. Transcriptional logic provides a flexible mechanism for defining genetic regulatory activity. Simulations demonstrate a realistic life cycle as an emergent property, and that even in simple environments lifelike and complex regulation mechanisms are evolved, including stable proteins, unstable mRNA, and repressor activity.

Here we propose a general framework to predict whether evolution benefits from learning or not. It is formulated in terms of the gain function, which quantifies the proportional change of fitness due to learning depending on the genotype value. With an inductive proof we show that a positive gain-function derivative implies that learning accelerates evolution, and a negative one implies deceleration under the condition that the population is distributed on a monotonic part of the fitness landscape.

We present, for the first time, results of a chemoton simulation in which these stochastic effects have been taken into account. We investigate the dynamics of the system and analyze in depth the mechanisms responsible for the observed behavior. Our results suggest that, in contrast to the most recent study by Munteanu and Solé, the stochastic chemoton reaches a unique stable division time after a short transient phase. We confirm the existence of an optimal template length and show that this is a consequence of the monomer concentration, which depends on the template length and the initiation threshold.

Yet while neuroevolution has produced successful results, the scale of natural brains remains far beyond reach. This article presents a method called hypercube-based NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (HyperNEAT) that aims to narrow this gap. HyperNEAT employs an indirect encoding called connective compositional pattern-producing networks (CPPNs) that can produce connectivity patterns with symmetries and repeating motifs by interpreting spatial patterns generated within a hypercube as connectivity patterns in a lower-dimensional space. This approach can exploit the geometry of the task by mapping its regularities onto the topology of the network, thereby shifting problem difficulty away from dimensionality to the underlying problem structure. Furthermore, connective CPPNs can represent the same connectivity pattern at any resolution, allowing ANNs to scale to new numbers of inputs and outputs without further evolution. HyperNEAT is demonstrated through visual discrimination and food-gathering tasks, including successful visual discrimination networks containing over eight million connections. The main conclusion is that the ability to explore the space of regular connectivity patterns opens up a new class of complex high-dimensional tasks to neuroevolution.","2009-04","2021-08-04 14:49:26","2021-08-04 14:49:26","2021-08-04 14:49:26","185-212","","2","15","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\KQWTIER7\Stanley et al. - 2009 - A Hypercube-Based Encoding for Evolving Large-Scal.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This approach has become rather popular recently, with new kinds of embryogenies being increasingly reported in the literature. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to analyze and compare the available embryogenies, especially if they are based on very different paradigms. We propose a method to analyze embryogenies based on growth dynamics, and how evolution is able to change them (heterochrony). We define several quantitative measures that allow us to establish the variation in growth dynamics that an embryogeny can create, the degree of change in growth dynamics caused by mutations, and the degree to which an embryogeny allows mutations to change the growth of a genotype, but without changing the final phenotype reached. These measures are based on an heterochrony framework, due to Alberch, Gould, Oster, & Wake (1979 Size and shape in ontogeny and phylogeny, Paleobiology, 5(3), 296–317) that is used in real biological organisms. The measures are general enough to be applied to any embryogeny, and can be easily computed from simple experiments. We further illustrate how to compute these measures by applying them to two simple embryogenies. These embryogenies exhibit rather different growth dynamics, and both allow for mutations that changed growth without affecting the final phenotype.","2009-04","2021-08-04 14:49:13","2021-08-04 14:49:13","2021-08-04 14:49:13","131-160","","2","15","","Artificial Life","Heterochrony and Artificial Embryogeny","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It also assumes that they have evolutionarily selected the PSD mechanism of turning biological polymers (BPs) into biological monomers (BMs) as an efficient biomolecular recycling strategy. We have examined the validity and effectiveness of the HBCB model by coordinating two complementary approaches: biological experiments using existent terrestrial life, and simulation experiments using an AChem system. Biological experiments have shown that terrestrial life possesses a PSD mechanism as an endergonic, genetically regulated process and that hydrolysis, which decomposes a BP into BMs, is one of the main processes of such a mechanism. In simulation experiments, we compared different virtual self-decomposition processes. The virtual species in which the self-decomposition process mainly involved covalent bond cleavage from a BP to BMs showed evolutionary superiority over other species in which the self-decomposition process involved cleavage from BP to classes lower than BM. These converging findings strongly support the existence of PSD and the validity and effectiveness of the HBCB model.","2009-01","2021-08-04 14:48:03","2021-08-04 14:48:03","2021-08-04 14:48:02","29-58","","1","15","","Artificial Life","An Effective Hierarchical Model for the Biomolecular Covalent Bond","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we demonstrate how viable computer programs can be established de novo in a Precambrian environment without supplying any specific instantiation, just starting with random bit sequences. These programs are not self-replicators, but act much more like catalysts. The microcontrollers used in the end are the result of a long series of simplifications. The objective of this simplification process was to produce universal machines with a human-readable interface, allowing software and/or hardware evolution to be studied. The power of the instruction set can be modified by introducing a secondary structure-folding mechanism, which is a state machine, allowing nontrivial replication to emerge with an instruction width of only a few bits. This state-machine approach not only attenuates the problems of brittleness and encoding functionality (too few bits available for coding, and too many instructions needed); it also enables the study of hardware evolution as such. Furthermore, the instruction set is sufficiently powerful to permit external signals to be processed. This information-theoretic approach forms one vertex of a triangle alongside artificial cell research and experimental research on the creation of life. Hopefully this work helps develop an understanding of how information—in a similar sense to the account of functional information described by Hazen et al.—is created by evolution and how this information interacts with or is embedded in its physico-chemical environment.","2010-10","2021-08-04 14:46:30","2021-08-04 14:46:30","2021-08-04 14:46:30","311-328","","4","16","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This model is built by integrating various previous models of language development and social learning, and it is this integration that, under the mentioned assumptions, provides novel challenges. The aim of the article is to investigate what sociocognitive mechanisms agents should have in order to be able to transmit language from one generation to the next so that it can be used as a medium to transmit internalized rules that represent skill knowledge. We have performed experiments where this knowledge solves the familiar poisonous-food problem. Simulations reveal under what conditions, regarding population structure, agents can successfully solve this problem. In addition to issues relating to perspective taking and mutual exclusivity, we show that agents need to coordinate interactions so that they can establish joint attention in order to form a scaffold for language learning, which in turn forms a scaffold for the learning of rule-based skills. Based on these findings, we conclude by hypothesizing that social learning at one level forms a scaffold for the social learning at another, higher level, thus contributing to the accumulation of cultural knowledge.","2010-10","2021-08-04 14:46:22","2021-08-04 14:46:22","2021-08-04 14:46:22","289-309","","4","16","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This process effectively increases linguistic learning capability by organizing a novel synergy of multiple lower-order functions previously irrelevant to the process of language acquisition. Deacon posits that this transition is not caused by natural selection. Rather, it is due to the relaxation of natural selection. While there are some cases in which relaxation caused by some external factors indeed induces the transition, we do not know what kind of relaxation has worked in language evolution. In this article, a genetic-algorithm-based computer simulation is used to investigate how the niche-constructing aspect of linguistic behavior may trigger the degradation of genetic predisposition related to language learning. The results show that agents initially increase their genetic predisposition for language learning—the Baldwin effect. They create a highly uniform sociolinguistic environment—a linguistic niche construction. This means that later generations constantly receive very similar inputs from adult agents, and subsequently the selective pressure to retain the genetic predisposition is relaxed.","2010-10","2021-08-04 14:46:16","2021-08-04 14:46:16","2021-08-04 14:46:16","271-287","","4","16","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since fewer colors create fewer independent sets, our finding implies that disassortative networks may have higher concurrency potential than assortative networks. This in turn suggests another reason for the disassortative mixing pattern observed in biological networks such as those of protein-protein interaction and gene regulation. In addition to the functional specificity and stability suggested by Maslov and Sneppen, a disassortative network topology may also enhance the ability of cells to perform crucial tasks concurrently.

In order for embodied artificial intelligence to gain credibility within the robotics and cognitive science communities, however, it is necessary to amass evidence not only for how to co-optimize morphology and control of adaptive machines, but why. This work provides two new lines of evidence for why this co-optimization is useful: Here we show that for an object manipulation task in which a simulated robot must accomplish one, two, or three objectives simultaneously, subjugating more aspects of the robot's morphology to selective pressure allows for the evolution of better robots as the number of objectives increases.

G-autonomy measures the extent to which the knowing the past of a variable helps predict its future, as compared to predictions based on past states of external (environmental) variables. G-emergence measures the extent to which a process is both dependent upon and autonomous from its underlying causal factors. These measures are validated by application to agent-based models of predation (for autonomy) and flocking (for emergence). In the former, evolutionary adaptation enhances autonomy; the latter model illustrates not only emergence but also downward causation.

To realize this biomimetic intelligent control, we require a stripped-down model that expresses a series of information-processing tasks from stimulation input to movement. Here we selected the bacterium Escherichia coli as a target organism because it has a relatively simple molecular and organizational structure, which can be characterized using biochemical and genetic analyses. We particularly focused on a motility response known as chemotaxis and developed a computer model that includes not only intracellular information processing but also motor control. After confirming the effectiveness and validity of the proposed model by a series of computer simulations, we applied it to a mobile robot control problem. This is probably the first study showing that a bacterial model can be used as an autonomous control algorithm.

In simpler organisms, however, pattern formation is intrinsic to growth and behavior. Inspired by one such organism, the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum, we present examples of complex emergent pattern formation and evolution formed by a population of simple particle-like agents. Using simple local behaviors based on chemotaxis, the mobile agent population spontaneously forms complex and dynamic transport networks. By adjusting simple model parameters, maps of characteristic patterning are obtained. Certain areas of the parameter mapping yield particularly complex long term behaviors, including the circular contraction of network lacunae and bifurcation of network paths to maintain network connectivity. We demonstrate the formation of irregular spots and labyrinthine and reticulated patterns by chemoattraction. Other Turing-like patterning schemes were obtained by using chemorepulsion behaviors, including the self-organization of regular periodic arrays of spots, and striped patterns. We show that complex pattern types can be produced without resorting to the hierarchical coupling of reaction-diffusion mechanisms. We also present network behaviors arising from simple pre-patterning cues, giving simple examples of how the emergent pattern formation processes evolve into networks with functional and quasi-physical properties including tensionlike effects, network minimization behavior, and repair to network damage. The results are interpreted in relation to classical theories of biological pattern formation in natural systems, and we suggest mechanisms by which emergent pattern formation processes may be used as a method for spatially represented unconventional computation.","2010-04","2021-08-04 14:44:46","2021-08-04 14:44:46","2021-08-04 14:44:46","127-153","","2","16","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\KHVKGNTA\Jones - 2010 - Characteristics of Pattern Formation and Evolution.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Commonly, the researcher wishes to investigate some specific or general mode of behavior, say, the ability of a coherent pattern of points to glide within the lattice, or to generate copies of itself. This technique has a problem: how to design the transitions table—the set of distinct rules that specify the next content of a cell from its current content and that of its near neighbors. Often the table is painstakingly designed manually, rule by rule. The problem is exacerbated by the potentially vast number of individual rules that need be specified to cover all combinations of center and neighbors when there are several symbols in the alphabet of the CA. In this article a method is presented to have the set of rules evolve automatically while running the CA. The transition table is initially empty, with rules being added as the need arises. A novel principle drives the evolution: maximum economy of means—maximizing the reuse of rules introduced on previous cycles. This method may not be a panacea applicable to all CA studies. Nevertheless, it is sufficiently potent to evolve sets of rules and associated patterns of points that glide (periodically regenerate themselves at another location) and to generate gliding “children” that then “mate” by collision.","2010-04","2021-08-04 14:44:35","2021-08-04 14:44:35","2021-08-04 14:44:35","119-126","","2","16","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we explore the feasibility of adopting genetic programming so that, when it is given a fairly arbitrary initial cellular automata configuration, it will automatically generate a set of rules that make the given configuration replicate. We found that this approach works surprisingly effectively for structures as large as 50 components or more. The replication mechanisms discovered by genetic programming work quite differently than those of many past manually designed replicators: There is no identifiable instruction sequence or construction arm, the replicating structures generally translate and rotate as they reproduce, and they divide via a fissionlike process that involves highly parallel operations. This makes replication very fast, and one cannot identify which descendant is the parent and which is the child. The ability to automatically generate self-replicating structures in this fashion allowed us to examine the resulting replicators as their properties were systematically varied. Further, it proved possible to produce replicators that simultaneously deposited secondary structures while replicating, as in some past manually designed models. We conclude that genetic programming is a powerful tool for studying self-replication that might also be profitably used in contexts other than cellular spaces.","2010-01","2021-08-04 14:42:46","2021-08-04 14:42:46","2021-08-04 14:42:46","39-63","","1","16","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While these two modes of survival are closely analogous to those expected to emerge in so-called r and K selection scenarios respectively, the bifurcation of evolutionary histories according to these functional niches occurs in identical environments, under identical selective pressures. We find that the branching occurs early, and leads to drastic phenotypic differences (in fitness, sequence length, and gestation time) that are permanent and irreversible.

The devices that are currently produced are usually intended for the mass market. The cost of production therefore is a major concern, even though the technology is more sophisticated and highly automated than in the past. Consequently, toymakers and engineers, as well as artists, of the past and present alike have had to think abstractly about living systems in order to construct their simulacra economically. This essay examines a number of lifelike toys to discover the properties of real organisms that their designers have attempted to recreate. That we, as users of these devices, so readily recognize in them a degree of lifelikeness demonstrates the extent to which intuition may sway our intellectual reasoning about real biology. As a result, an innovative toymaker or artist is able to manipulate us to zoomorphize even the most extreme abstractions—at least momentarily—despite our rational reluctance to accept the trickery.","2004-01","2021-08-04 16:09:36","2021-08-04 16:09:36","2021-08-04 16:09:36","99-112","","1","10","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This latter phase demands a strong correlation between genotype and phenotype space. But the natural world shows signs of this correlation at only a very coarse level, since the intervening developmental process greatly complicates the mapping from genetics to physiology and ethology. Hence, development appears to preclude a strong Baldwin effect. However, by adding a simple developmental mechanism to Hinton and Nowlan's classic model of the Baldwin effect, and by allowing evolution to determine the proper balance between direct and indirect mapping of genome to phenotype, this research reveals several different effects of development on the Baldwin effect, some promoting and others inhibiting. Perhaps the most interesting result is an evolved cooperation between direct blueprints and indirect developmental recipes in searching for unstructured and partially structured target patterns in large, needle-in-the-haystack fitness landscapes.","2004-01","2021-08-04 16:09:17","2021-08-04 16:09:17","2021-08-04 16:09:17","39-63","","1","10","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\4HJ6FEW5\Downing - 2004 - Development and the Baldwin Effect.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show here that folding also plays a key role in enhancing the evolutionary stability of the intermolecular recognition necessary for the prevalent mode of catalytic action in replication, namely, in trans, one molecule catalyzing the replication of another copy, rather than itself. This points to a novel aspect of why molecular life is structured as it is, in the context of life as it could be: folding allows limited, structurally localized recognition to be strongly sensitive to global sequence changes, facilitating the evolution of cooperative interactions. RNA secondary structure folding, for example is shown to be able to stabilize the evolution of prolonged functional sequences, using only a part of this length extension for intermolecular recognition, beyond the limits of the (cooperative) error threshold. Such folding could facilitate the evolution of polymerases in spatially heterogeneous systems. This facilitation is, in fact, vital because physical limitations prevent complete sequence-dependent discrimination for any significant-size biopolymer substrate. The influence of partial sequence recognition between biopolymer catalysts and complex substrates is investigated within a stochastic, spatially resolved evolutionary model of trans catalysis. We use an analytically tractable nonlinear master equation formulation called PRESS (McCaskill et al., Biol.

This concept is of concern to both evolutionary theoreticians and molecular biologists who use nucleic acid selection techniques to mimic biotic and computorial processes in the test tube. Using the continuous in vitro evolution methodology, many replicate experimental evolutionary lineages with populations of catalytic RNA were performed to gain insight into the parameters that could affect recurrence. The likelihood that the same genotype will result in parallel trials of an evolution experiment in vitro depends on several factors, including the phenotype under selection, the size and composition of the initial diverse pool of nucleic acids used in the experiment, the degree of mutation possible during the experiment, the shape of the fitness landscape through which the population evolves, and the strategies used to invoke selection and to search the landscape, among others. By considering these factors, it can be predicted that recurrence is more likely when a small, wild-type-based starting pool is used with efficient selection and search strategies involving little online mutagenesis within a rugged adaptive landscape with a strong local optimum. The recurrence experiments performed here on the 150-nucleotide ligase ribozyme demonstrate that it repeatedly jumps from one peak in a fitness landscape to another, apparently hurdling a deep fitness valley. These predictions can and should be tested by additional multiple replicates of actual evolution experiments in the laboratory.","2004-01","2021-08-04 16:09:01","2021-08-04 16:09:01","2021-08-04 16:09:01","1-22","","1","10","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is required that each level describe a self-contained deterministic dynamical system. We show that a necessary and sufficient condition for a projective map to be a transition between levels in the hierarchy is that the kernel of the differential of the map is tangent to an invariant manifold with respect to the flow. The implications of this condition are discussed in detail. We demonstrate two different causal dependences between degrees of freedom, and how these relations are revealed when the dynamical system is transformed into global Jordan form.

Simon's characterization of modularity in dynamical systems describes subsystems as having dynamics that are approximately independent of those of other subsystems (in the short term). This fits with the general intuition that modules must, by definition, be approximately independent. In the evolution of complex systems, such modularity may enable subsystems to be modified and adapted independently of other subsystems, whereas in a nonmodular system, modifications to one part of the system may result in deleterious side effects elsewhere in the system. But this notion of modularity and its effect on evolvability is not well quantified and is rather simplistic. In particular, modularity need not imply that intermodule dependences are weak or unimportant. In dynamical systems this is acknowledged by Simon's suggestion that, in the long term, the dynamical behaviors of subsystems do interact with one another, albeit in an “aggregate” manner—but this kind of intermodule interaction is omitted in models of modularity for evolvability.

This review aims to provide an overview of important and disparate research contributions that investigate utilization of biologically inspired concepts such as emergence, evolution, and self-organization as a means of attaining cooperation in artificial social systems.             An introduction and overview of emergent cooperation in artificial life is presented, followed by a survey of emergent cooperation in swarm-based systems, the pursuit-evasion domain, and RoboCup soccer. The final section draws conclusions regarding future directions of emergent cooperation as a problem-solving methodology that is potentially applicable in a wide range of problem domains. Within each of these sections and their respective themes of research, the mechanisms deemed to be responsible for emergent cooperation are elucidated and their key limitations highlighted. The review concludes that current studies in emergent cooperative behavior are limited by a lack of situated and embodied approaches, and by the research infancy of current biologically inspired design approaches. Despite these limiting factors, emergent cooperation maintains considerable future potential in a wide variety of application domains where systems composed of many interacting components must cooperatively perform unanticipated global tasks.","2005-06","2021-08-04 16:05:00","2021-08-04 16:05:00","2021-08-04 16:05:00","367-396","","3","11","","Artificial Life","Emergence of Cooperation","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After examining self-replicating structures and the way they reproduce, we consider their fractal properties and scale invariance. We explore the space of all possible mutations, showing that despite their apparent differences, many patterns produced by CAs are based on universal models of development and that mutations may lead either to stable or to unstable development dynamics. An example of this process for all possible one-step mutations of one specific CA is given. We have demonstrated that a self-replicating system can carry out many slightly different but related entities, realizing new different growth models. We infer that self-replicating systems exist in an intermediate regime between order and chaos, showing that these models degrade into chaotic configurations, passing through a series of transition stages. This process is quantified by measuring the Hamming distances between the pattern produced by the original self-replicator and those produced by mutated systems. The analysis shows that many different mechanisms may be involved in patterning phenomena. These include changes in the external or internal layers of the structure, substitution of elements, differential rates of growth in different parts of the structure, structural modifications, changes in the original model, the emergence of different structures governed by different CA rules, and changes in the self-replication process.","2005-06","2021-08-04 16:04:40","2021-08-04 16:04:40","2021-08-04 16:04:40","339-362","","3","11","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The fact that the biological neural architectures are found to be highly repetitive, layered, and topographically organized has important consequences for neural development methods. The purpose of this article is to propose a neural development method that can construct topographical neural connections, that is, a topographical development method, to facilitate fast and efficient development. This is achieved by arborizing neural connections on a developmental tree that rarely produces dead connections. Modular gene expression and corresponding modular networks have an important role in a gradual evolutionary process. Gene expression for modular networks is also proposed here as a way to reduce the probability of fatal mutants created through gene alteration. The corresponding evolutionary experiment shows that various neural structures—layered, repetitive, modular, and complex ones like those in the biological brain—can be constructed and easily observed. It also demonstrates that due to the efficiency of the proposed method, large neural networks can be easily managed, thereby making it suitable for long duration evolutionary experiments.","2005-06","2021-08-04 16:04:27","2021-08-04 16:04:27","2021-08-04 16:04:27","293-316","","3","11","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These two questions are best addressed together, since our answers to the first may inform the second. The key move in scaling up simple embodied cognitive science is, I argue, to take very seriously the potent role of human-built structures in transforming the spaces of human learning and reason. In particular, in this article I look at a range of cases involving what I dub surrogate situations. Here, we actively create restricted artificial environments that allow us to deploy basic perception-action-reason routines in the absence of their proper objects. Examples include the use of real-world models, diagrams, and other concrete external symbols to support dense looping interactions with a variety of stable external structures that stand in for the absent states of affairs. Language itself, I finally suggest, is the most potent and fundamental form of such surrogacy. Words are both cheap stand-ins for gross behavioral outcomes, and the concrete objects that structure new spaces for basic forms of learning and reason. A good hard look at surrogate situatedness thus turns the standard skeptical challenge on its head. But it raises important questions concerning what really matters about these new approaches, and it helps focus what I see as the major challenge for the future: how, in detail, to conceptualize the role of symbols (both internal and external) in dynamical cognitive processes.","2005-01","2021-08-04 16:03:23","2021-08-04 16:03:23","2021-08-04 16:03:23","233-244","","1-2","11","","Artificial Life","Beyond the Flesh","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\LPLDT843\Clark - 2005 - Beyond the Flesh Some Lessons from a Mole Cricket.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first of these challenges, the threat from nontrivial causal spread, occurs when extra-neural factors account for the kind of adaptive richness and flexibility normally associated with representation-based control. The second, the threat from continuous reciprocal causation, occurs when the causal contributions made by the systemic components collectively responsible for behavior generation are massively context-sensitive and variable over time.

This study consists of novel computer experiments in the evolution of cellular automata to perform nontrivial tasks as well as evidence from biology concerning genetic memory. Our key observation is that representations require inert structures to encode information used to construct appropriate dynamic configurations for the evolving system. We propose criteria to decide if a given structure is a representation by unpacking the idea of inert structures that can be used as memory for arbitrary dynamic configurations. Using a genetic algorithm, we evolved cellular automata rules that can perform nontrivial tasks related to the density task (or majority classification problem) commonly used in the literature. We present the particle catalogs of the new rules following the computational mechanics framework. We discuss if the evolved cellular automata particles may be seen as representations according to our criteria. We show that while they capture some of the essential characteristics of representations, they lack an essential one. Our goal is to show that artificial life can be used to shed new light on the computation-versus-dynamics debate in cognitive science, and indeed function as a constructive bridge between the two camps.

For example, many animals endogenously synthesize ascorbic acid (vitamin C), but anthropoid primates have only a nonfunctional version of the crucial gene for this pathway. It is hypothesized that the loss of functionality occurred in the evolutionary past when a diet rich in vitamin C masked the effect of the gene, and its loss effectively trapped the animals in a fruit-eating lifestyle. As a result, the complex of abilities that support this lifestyle were evolutionarily bound together, forming a multilocus complex. In this study we use evolutionary computation simulations to explore the thesis that masking and unmasking can transfer dependence from one set of genes to many sets, and thereby integrate the whole complex of genes. We used a framework based on Hinton and Nowlan's 1987 simulation of the Baldwin effect. Additional gene complexes and an environmental parameter were added to their basic model, and the fitness function extended. The simulation clearly demonstrates that the genetic redistribution effect can occur in silico, showing an initial advantage of endogenously synthesized vitamin C, followed by transfer of the fitness contribution to the complex of genes that together allow the acquisition of vitamin C from the environment. As is well known in the modeling community, the Baldwin effect only occurs in simulations when the population of agents is “poised on the brink” of discovering the genetically specified solution. Similarly, the redistribution effect occurs in simulations under specific initial conditions: too little vitamin C in the environment, and its synthesis it is never fully masked; too much vitamin C, and the abilities required to acquire it are not tightly integrated. The Baldwin effect has been hypothesized as a potential mechanism for developing language-specific adaptations like innate universal grammar and other highly modular capacities.

In the case of basic (natural) autonomous systems, self-construction and activity in the environment are two aspects of the same organization, the distinction between which is entirely conceptual: their sensorimotor activities are metabolic, realized according to the same principles and through the same material transformations as those typical of internal processes (such as energy transduction). The two aspects begin to be distinguishable in a particular evolutionary trend, related to the size increase of some groups of organisms whose adaptive abilities depend on motility. Here a specialized system develops, which, in the sensorimotor aspect, is decoupled from the metabolic basis, although it remains dependent on it in the self-constructive aspect. This decoupling reveals a complexification of the organization. In the last section of the article this approach to natural agency is used to analyze artificial systems by posing two problems: whether it is possible to artificially build an organization similar to the natural, and whether this notion of agency can be grounded on different organizing principles.","2005-01","2021-08-04 16:03:01","2021-08-04 16:03:01","2021-08-04 16:03:01","161-175","","1-2","11","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accordingly, our group has constructed a series of brain-based devices (BBDs), that is, physical devices with simulated nervous systems that guide behavior, to serve as a heuristic for testing theories of brain function. Unlike animal models, BBDs permit analysis of activity at all levels of the nervous system as the device behaves in its environment.

It is possible for the robot to bootstrap from this imitative ability to infer the affective reaction of the human with whom it interacts and then use this affective assessment to guide its subsequent behavior. Our approach is heavily influenced by the ways human infants learn to communicate with their caregivers and come to understand the actions and expressive behavior of others in intentional and motivational terms.

Experiments with CancerSim are described that study the interactions of cell phenotype alterations, and in particular, the likely sequences of precancerous mutations, known as pathways. The experiments show that sequencing is an important factor in tumorigenesis, as some mutations have preconditions—they are selectively advantageous only in combination with other mutations.

Here we vary two critical parameters in a standard model of tag-mediated altruism—genetic stability and territorial structure—and show that altruism evolves in a wide range of conditions.

Using this scenario, the evolution to the first eukaryotic cell can be modeled in three steps, based on the self-assembly of cellular membranes by lipid-protein interactions. First, the inclusion of chromosomes in a nuclear membrane is mediated by interactions between laminar proteins and lipid vesicles. Second, the formation of a primitive endoplasmic reticulum, or exomembrane, is induced by the expression of intrinsic membrane proteins. Third, a plasma membrane is formed by fusion of exomembrane vesicles on the cytoskeletal protein scaffold. All three self-assembly processes occur both in vivo and in vitro.

A representation of an arbitrary Turing machine is reproduced in terms of structural constraints by means of a simple mapping from tape squares and machine states to a uniform medium of nodes and links, establishing computation universality. Exploiting flexibility of the formulation, examples of other unconventional “self-computing” structures are demonstrated. A straightforward representation of a kinematic machine system based on the model devised by Laing is also reproduced in detail. Implications of the findings are discussed in terms of their relation to other formal models of computation and construction.

The research presented here is intended to be a step towards this vision. We describe a computational simulation of nanoscale machines floating in a virtual liquid. The machines can bond together to form strands (chains) that self-replicate and self-assemble into user-specified meshes. There are four types of machines, and the sequence of machine types in a strand determines the shape of the mesh they will build. A strand may be in an unfolded state, in which the bonds are straight, or in a folded state, in which the bond angles depend on the types of machines. By choosing the sequence of machine types in a strand, the user can specify a variety of polygonal shapes. A simulation typically begins with an initial unfolded seed strand in a soup of unbonded machines. The seed strand replicates by bonding with free machines in the soup. The child strands fold into the encoded polygonal shape, and then the polygons drift together and bond to form a mesh. We demonstrate that a variety of polygonal meshes can be manufactured in the simulation, by simply changing the sequence of machine types in the seed.","2006-07","2021-08-04 15:58:27","2021-08-04 15:58:27","2021-08-04 15:58:27","411-433","","3","12","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\GACWYGKS\Ewaschuk and Turney - 2006 - Self-Replication and Self-Assembly for Manufacturi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The article shows how distributed coordination allows a group of evolved, physically linked simulated robots (inspired by a robot under construction) to display a variety of highly coordinated basic behaviors such as collective motion, collective obstacle avoidance, and collective approach to light, and to integrate them in a coherent fashion. In this way the group is capable of searching and approaching a lighted target in an environment scattered with obstacles, furrows, and holes, where robots acting individually fail. The article shows how the emerged coordination of the group relies upon robust self-organizing principles (e.g., positive feedback) based on a novel sensor that allows the single robots to perceive the group's “average” motion direction. The article also presents a robust solution to a difficult coordination problem, which might also be encountered by some organisms, caused by the fact that the robots have to be capable of moving in any direction while being physically connected. Finally, the article shows how the evolved distributed coordination mechanisms scale very well with respect to the number of robots, the way in which robots are assembled, the structure of the environment, and several other aspects.","2006-07","2021-08-04 15:57:35","2021-08-04 15:57:35","2021-08-04 15:57:35","289-311","","3","12","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the most natural ways to explore complex spaces is for a user to actively navigate through them, using local explorations and global summaries to develop intuitions about structure, and then testing the developing ideas by further exploration. This article provides a brief overview of a technique for visualizing surfaces defined over moderate-dimensional binary spaces, by recursively unfolding them onto a 2D hypergraph. We briefly summarize the uses of a freely available Web-based visualization tool, Hyperspace Graph Paper (HSGP), for exploring fitness landscapes and search algorithms in evolutionary computation. HSGP provides a way for a user to actively explore a landscape, from simple tasks such as mapping the neighborhood structure of different points, to seeing global properties such as the size and distribution of basins of attraction or how different search algorithms interact with landscape structure. It has been most useful for exploring recursive and repetitive landscapes, and its strength is that it allows intuitions to be developed through active navigation by the user, and exploits the visual system's ability to detect pattern and texture. The technique is most effective when applied to continuous functions over Boolean variables using 4 to 16 dimensions.","2006-01","2021-08-04 15:55:21","2021-08-04 15:55:21","2021-08-04 15:55:21","211-216","","2","12","","Artificial Life","Hyperspace Geography","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\VKHPQLPN\Wiles and Tonkes - 2006 - Hyperspace Geography Visualizing Fitness Landscap.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Not only the information in DNA, but also smaller molecules responsible for the transcription and translation of DNA into amino acids, are adaptively changed during evolution, which optimizes the fundamental mapping from binary substrings in DNA (genotype) to real values for a parameter set (phenotype). Through the struggle between cells containing a DNA unit and small molecular units, the codes (DNA) and the interpreter (the small molecular units) coevolve, and a specific output function, from which a cell's fitness is evaluated, is optimized. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the CGA, it is applied to a set of variable-separable and variable-inseparable problems, and it is shown that the CGA can robustly solve a wide range of optimization problems regardless of their fitness characteristics. To ascertain the optimization of the genotypeto-phenotype mapping by the CGA, we also conduct analytical experiments for some problems while observing the basin size of a global optimum solution in the binary genotype space. The results show that the CGA effectively augments the basin size, makes it easier for evolution to find a path to the global optimum solution, and enhances the GA's evolvability during evolution.","2006-01","2021-08-04 15:50:23","2021-08-04 15:50:23","2021-08-04 15:50:23","89-115","","1","12","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research on humanoid robotics has focused on the control of manipulators and walking machines. The contributions of the torso towards ordinary movements (such as walking, dancing, attracting mates, and maintaining balance) have been neglected by almost all humanoid robotic researchers. We believe that the next generation of humanoid robots will incorporate a flexible spine in the torso. To meet the challenge of controlling this kind of high-degree-of-freedom robot, a new control architecture is necessary. Inspired by the rhythmic movements commonly exhibited in lamprey locomotion as well as belly dancing, we designed a controller for a simulated belly-dancing robot using the lamprey central pattern generator. Experimental results show that the proposed lamprey central pattern generator module could potentially generate plausible output patterns, which could be used for all the possible spine motions with minimized control parameters. For instance, in the case of planar spine motions, only three input parameters are required. Using our controller, the simulated robot is able to perform complex torso movements commonly seen in belly dancing as well. Our work suggests that the proposed controller can potentially be a suitable controller for a high-degree-of-freedom, flexible spine humanoid robot. Furthermore, it allows us to gain a better understanding of belly dancing by synthesis.","2006-01","2021-08-04 15:49:26","2021-08-04 15:49:26","2021-08-04 15:49:26","63-88","","1","12","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More recently, it has been applied in a data-mining context to perform both clustering and topographic mapping. Early work demonstrated some promising characteristics of the heuristic but did not extend to a rigorous investigation of its capabilities. We describe an improved version, called ATTA, incorporating adaptive, heterogeneous ants, a time-dependent transporting activity, and a method (for clustering applications) that transforms the spatial embedding produced by the algorithm into an explicit partitioning. ATTA is then subjected to the most rigorous experimental evaluation of an ant-based clustering and sorting algorithm undertaken to date: we compare its performance with standard techniques for clustering and topographic mapping using a set of analytical evaluation functions and a range of synthetic and real data collections. Our results demonstrate the ability of ant-based clustering and sorting to automatically identify the number of clusters inherent in a data collection, and to produce high quality solutions; indeed, we show that it is particularly robust for clusters of differing sizes and for overlapping clusters. The results obtained for topographic mapping are, however, disappointing. We provide evidence that the solutions generated by the ant algorithm are barely topology-preserving, and we explain in detail why results have—in spite of this—been misinterpreted (much more positively) in previous research.","2006-01","2021-08-04 15:49:13","2021-08-04 15:49:13","2021-08-04 15:49:13","35-62","","1","12","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\G38Q9MWX\Handl et al. - 2006 - Ant-Based Clustering and Topographic Mapping.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The combination of spiking dynamics with incremental evolution leads to the successful evolution of agents counting over very long periods. Analysis of the evolved networks unravels the counting mechanism and demonstrates how the spiking dynamics are utilized.

By exploiting RNA-directed recombination reactions previously developed in our laboratory, including a ribozyme self-assembly pathway, we demonstrate that it is possible for information to be exchanged among protocells. This can happen either indirectly by the passage of divalent cations through the inter-protocellular medium (oil), or by the direct interaction of two or more protocells that allows RNA molecules to be exchanged. The degree of agitation affects the ability of such exchange. The consequences of these results include the implications that prototypical living systems can transmit information among compartments, and that the environment can regulate the extent of this crosstalk.","2007-07","2021-08-04 15:01:54","2021-08-04 15:01:54","2021-08-04 15:01:54","279-289","","3","13","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent ethological studies have reported a unique syntactic communication of a songbird, the Bengalese finch (Lonchura striata var. domestica). Male Bengalese finches sing complex courtship songs, which can be reconstructed by finite automata, and female Bengalese finches prefer complex songs, as opposed to monotonous or random ones. These facts suggest that the song syntaxes of male birds may have evolved as a result of sexual selection by female birds. Inspired by this hypothesis, we developed a communication model that is a system coupling different types of automaton, one for song production by males and another for song evaluation by females. We applied this model to study the evolution of syntactic animal communication in terms of the self-organization of coevolving automata. Three types of courting strategies as well as a relationship between the song syntax and female preference emerged. We argue that despite the simple communication involved, the complexity and diversity of song syntaxes can evolve via diverse female preferences.","2007-07","2021-08-04 15:01:47","2021-08-04 15:01:47","2021-08-04 15:01:47","259-277","","3","13","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, morphogenesis arises as a side-effect of maximization of number of cell types. Thus, it investigates the evolutionary dynamics of side-effects. Morphogenesis is governed by the interplay between differential cell adhesion, gene-regulation, and intercellular signaling. Thus, it investigates the potential to generate complex behavior by entanglement of relatively “boring” processes, and the (automatic) coordination between these processes.             The evolutionary dynamics shows all the hallmarks of evolutionary dynamics governed by nonlinear genotype phenotype mapping: for example, punctuated equilibria and diffusion on neutral paths. More striking is the result that interesting, complex morphogenesis occurs mainly in the “shadow” of neutral paths which preserve cell differentiation, that is, the interesting morphologies arise as mutants of the fittest individuals.             Characteristics of the evolution of such side-effects in the shadow appear to be the following: (1) The specific complex morphologies are unique (or at least very rare) among the set of de novo initiated evolutionary histories. (2) Similar morphologies are reinvented at large temporal distances during one evolutionary history and also when evolution is restarted after the main cell differentiation pattern has been established. (3) A mosaic-like evolution at the morphological level, where different morphological features occur in many combinations, while at the genotypic level recombination is not implemented and genotypes diverge linearly and at a constant rate.","2000-01","2021-08-04 16:53:07","2021-08-04 16:53:07","2021-08-04 16:53:07","85-101","","1","6","","Artificial Life","Shapes in the Shadow","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\8G6964EJ\Hogeweg - 2000 - Shapes in the Shadow Evolutionary Dynamics of Mor.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We compare a nonmodular feed-forward network, a hardwired modular, and a duplication-based modular motor control network. We conclude that both modular architectures outperform the non-modular architecture, both in terms of rate of adaptation as well as the level of adaptation achieved. The main difference between the hardwired and duplication-based modular architectures is that in the latter the modules reached a much higher degree of functional specialization of their motor control units with regard to high-level behavioral functions. The hardwired architectures reach the same level of performance, but have a more distributed assignment of functional tasks to the motor control units. We conclude that the mechanism through which functional specialization is achieved is similar to the mechanism proposed for the evolution of duplicated genes. It is found that the duplication of multifunctional modules first leads to a change in the regulation of the module, leading to a differentiation of the functional context in which the module is used. Then the module adapts to the new functional context. After this second step the system is locked into a functionally specialized state. We suggest that functional specialization may be an evolutionary absorption state.","2000-01","2021-08-04 16:53:01","2021-08-04 16:53:01","2021-08-04 16:53:01","69-84","","1","6","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\DNPNSSNF\Calabretta et al. - 2000 - Duplication of Modules Facilitates the Evolution o.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using this we motivate an algebraic definition of the complexity of biological systems, comparing it to other candidates such as genome size and number of cell types. We show that our complexity measure is the unique maximal complexity measure satisfying a natural set of axioms. This reveals a strong relationship between hierarchical complexity in biological systems and the area of algebra known as global semigroup theory. We then study the rate at which hierarchical complexity can evolve in biological systems assuming evolution is “as slow as possible” from the perspective of computational power of organisms. Explicit bounds on the evolution of complexity are derived showing that, although the evolutionary changes in hierarchical complexity are bounded, in some circumstances complexity may more than double in certain “genius jumps” of evolution. In fact, examples show that our bounds are sharp. We sketch the structure where such complexity jumps are known to occur and note some similarities to previously identified mechanisms in biological evolutionary transitions. We also address the question of, How fast can complexity evolve over longer periods of time? Although complexity may more than double in a single generation, we prove that in a smooth sequence of t “inclusion” steps, complexity may grow at most from N to .N C 1/t C N, a linear function of number of generations t, while for sequences of “mapping” steps it increases by at most t. Thus, despite the fact that there are major transitions in which complexity jumps are possible, over longer periods of time, the growth of complexity may be broken into maximal intervals on which it is bounded above in the manner described.","2000-01","2021-08-04 16:52:56","2021-08-04 16:52:56","2021-08-04 16:52:56","45-67","","1","6","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we describe a process where no genetic configuration space closure (and hence, no non-arbitrary notion of distance and neighborhood) exists. The process is gene duplication by means of unequal crossover, which we regard as an example of an “innovation” process that changes the state space of the system rather than exploring a closed state space.

Analysis reproduces several qualitative conclusions of Ijspeert et al.: namely, the different dynamical regimes for different values of the ratio of robots to sticks, the existence of optimal control parameters that maximize system performance as a function of group size, and the transition from superlinear to sublinear performance as the number of robots is increased.","2001-10","2021-08-04 16:27:49","2021-08-04 16:27:49","2021-08-04 16:27:49","375-393","","4","7","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\HUTG6GTW\Lerman et al. - 2001 - A Macroscopic Analytical Model of Collaboration in.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Out of the analysis of the most important parameters available to this end we proposed some guidelines that should be followed when defining a parameter of that kind. Based upon the guidelines, new parameters were proposed and a set of five parameters was selected; two of them were drawn from the literature and three are new ones, defined here. This article presents all of them and makes their qualities evident. Then, two results are described, related to the use of the parameter set in the Elementary Rule Space: a phase transition diagram, and some general heuristics for forecasting the dynamics of one-dimensional CA. Finally, as an example of the application of the selected parameters in high cardinality spaces, results are presented from experiments involving the evolution of radius-3 CA in the Density Classification Task, and radius-2 CA in the Synchronization Task.","2001-07","2021-08-04 16:26:33","2021-08-04 16:26:33","2021-08-04 16:26:33","277-301","","3","7","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Signaling in this world can be either beneficial (e.g., warning of nearby predators) or costly (e.g., attracting predators or competing agents). Our goals were twofold: to examine systematically environmental conditions under which grounded signaling does or does not evolve, and to determine how variations in assumptions made about the evolutionary process influence the outcome. Among other things, we found that agents warning of nearby predators were a common occurrence whenever predators had a significant impact on survival and signaling could interfere with predator success. The setting most likely to lead to food signaling was found to be difficult-to-locate food sources that each have relatively large amounts of food. Deviations from the selection methods typically used in traditional genetic algorithms were also found to have a substantial impact on whether communication evolved. For example, constraining parent selection and child placement to physically neighboring areas facilitated evolution of signaling in general, whereas basing parent selection upon survival alone rather than survival plus fitness measured as success in food acquisition was more conducive to the emergence of predator alarm signals. We examine the mechanisms underlying these and other results, relate them to existing experimental data about animal signaling, and discuss their implications for artificial life research involving evolution of communication.","2001-01","2021-08-04 16:23:53","2021-08-04 16:23:53","2021-08-04 16:23:53","3-32","","1","7","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although most insects have immobile eyes with fixed focus optics and lack stereo vision, they use a number of ingenious, computationally simple strategies for perceiving their world in three dimensions and navigating successfully within it. We are distilling selected insect-inspired strategies to obtain novel solutions for navigation, hazard avoidance, altitude hold, stable flight, terrain following, and gentle deployment of payload. Such functionality provides potential solutions for future autonomous robotic space and planetary explorers. A BEES approach to developing lightweight low-power autonomous flight systems should be useful for flight control of such biomorphic flyers for both NASA and DoD needs. Recent biological studies of mammalian retinas confirm that representations of multiple features of the visual world are systematically parsed and processed in parallel. Features are mapped to a stack of cellular strata within the retina. Each of these representations can be efficiently modeled in semiconductor cellular nonlinear network (CNN) chips. We describe recent breakthroughs in exploring the feasibility of the unique blending of insect strategies of navigation with mammalian visual search, pattern recognition, and image understanding into hybrid biomorphic flyers for future planetary and terrestrial applications. We describe a few future mission scenarios for Mars exploration, uniquely enabled by these newly developed biomorphic flyers.","2002-10","2021-08-04 16:22:56","2021-08-04 16:22:56","2021-08-04 16:22:56","357-369","","4","8","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\VRADLZ54\Thakoor et al. - 2002 - Bioinspired Engineering of Exploration Systems for.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article presents new simulations of an artificial life model for the evolution of compositional languages. It specifically addresses the role of cultural variation and of learning costs in the Baldwin effect for the evolution of language. Results show that when a high cost is associated with language learning, agents gradually assimilate in their genome some explicit features (e.g., lexical properties) of the specific language they are exposed to. When the structure of the language is allowed to vary through cultural transmission, Baldwinian processes cause, instead, the assimilation of a predisposition to learn, rather than any structural properties associated with a specific language. The analysis of the mechanisms underlying such a predisposition in terms of categorical perception supports Deacon's hypothesis regarding the Baldwinian inheritance of general underlying cognitive capabilities that serve language acquisition. This is in opposition to the thesis that argues for assimilation of structural properties needed for the specification of a full-blown language acquisition device.","2002-10","2021-08-04 16:22:45","2021-08-04 16:22:45","2021-08-04 16:22:45","311-339","","4","8","","Artificial Life","Learning and the Evolution of Language","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The method is based on composite epigenotypes with two parts: a binary genotype; and a mapping of genes onto phenotype characters. For such generalized epigenotypes the modularity is determined in the following intuitive way: The genes are divided into two subgroups; simultaneously with this decomposition there is defined an accompanying decomposition of the set of phenotype characters. We expect that for epigenotypes with modular structures the genes from one group will be mapped onto characters from the same group, that is, that the appearance of crosslink mappings will be maximally suppressed. A fundamental question for all of evolutionary biology (and also for evolutionary algorithms and connectionist cognitive science) is the mechanism of evolutionary emergence of modular structures. The presented explanatory model is an implementation of the assumption that variation in genotype is produced on a faster time scale than variation in the genotype-phenotype mapped part. Moreover, the evaluation of the epigenotype in the evolutionary algorithm is based on directly selectable properties (corresponding to the decomposition of the set of phenotype characters). The modularity of genotypephenotype mapping emerges in the simulations.","2002-10","2021-08-04 16:22:39","2021-08-04 16:22:39","2021-08-04 16:22:39","295-310","","4","8","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigate this hypothesis via the experimental manipulation of genetic redundancy in evolving populations of simulated robots controlled by artificial neural networks. A genetic algorithm is used to simulate the evolution of robots with the ability to perform a previously studied task. Redundancy is measured using systematic lesioning. In our experiments, populations of robots with larger genotypes achieve systematically higher fitness than populations whose genotypes are smaller. It is shown that, in principle, robots with smaller genotypes have enough computational power to achieve optimal fitness. Populations with larger (redundant) genotypes appear, however, to be more evolvable and display significantly higher diversity. It is argued that this enhanced evolvability is a direct effect of genetic redundancy, which allows populations of redundant robots to explore neutral networks spanning large areas of genotype space. We conjecture that, where cost considerations allow, redundancy in functional or potentially functional components of the genome may make a valuable contribution to evolution in artificial and perhaps in biological systems. The methods described in the article provide a practical way of testing this hypothesis for the artificial case.","2002-07","2021-08-04 16:21:51","2021-08-04 16:21:51","2021-08-04 16:21:51","265-277","","3","8","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Little theoretical analysis has been done previously concerning how to predict such distances. In this paper, we derive a probabilistic method that, for an agent at an arbitrary location in a two-dimensional cellular world, predicts the expected distance to a nearest other agent. Our method works for many world topologies, and we apply it to determine the expected distance for six commonly used ones. Further, the method is readily adapted to handle special restrictions. Over a wide variety of agent densities we show that the theoretically predicted distances are largely in agreement with the distances measured in computational experiments with randomly placed agents. We then utilize our prediction method to interpret recent observations that an imprecise threshold in the density of agents exists for the evolution of communication. We thus illustrate that, despite its conceptual simplicity, our method can aid the analysis and even the design of complex artificial environments populated by agents that have the potential to interact with one another.","2002-07","2021-08-04 16:21:43","2021-08-04 16:21:43","2021-08-04 16:21:43","247-264","","3","8","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents an example of a generative representation for the concurrent evolution of the morphology and neural controller of simulated robots, and also introduces GENRE, an evolutionary system for evolving designs using this representation. Applying GENRE to the task of evolving robots for locomotion and comparing it against a non-generative (direct) representation shows that the generative representation system rapidly produces robots with significantly greater fitness. Analyzing these results shows that the generative representation system achieves better performance by capturing useful bias from the design space and by allowing viable large scale mutations in the phenotype. Generative representations thereby enable the encapsulation, coordination, and reuse of assemblies of parts.","2002-07","2021-08-04 16:21:36","2021-08-04 16:21:36","2021-08-04 16:21:36","223-246","","3","8","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our earlier system, GUILD [Downing and Zvirinsky, (1999) Artificial Life, 5, 291–318], displayed emergent regulation of the chemical environment by a population of metabolizing agents, but the chemical model underlying those results was trivial, essentially admitting all possible reactions at a single energy cost. The new model, METAMIC, utilizes abstract chemistries that are both (a) constrained to a small set of legal reactions, and (b) grounded in basic fundamental relationships between energy, entropy, and biomass synthesis/breakdown.             To explore the general phenomena of emergent homeostasis, we generate 100 different chemistries and use each as the basis for several METAMIC runs, as part of aGaia hunt. This search discovers 20 chemistries that support microbial populations capable of regulating a physical environmental factor within their growth-optimal range, despite the extra metabolic cost. Case studies from the Gaia hunt illustrate a few simple mechanisms by which real biota might exploit the underlying chemistry to achieve some control over their physical environment. Although these results shed little light on the question of Gaia on Earth, they support the possibility of emergent environmental control at the microcosmic level.","2002-04","2021-08-04 16:20:41","2021-08-04 16:20:41","2021-08-04 16:20:41","123-153","","2","8","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\PG458VAI\Downing - 2002 - The Simulated Emergence of Distributed Environment.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional explanations for the emergence of syntactic structure employ an argument based on genetic evolution: Syntactic structure is specified by an innate language acquisition device (LAD). Knowledge of language is complex, yet the data available to the language learner are sparse. This incongruous situation, termed the “poverty of the stimulus,” is accounted for by placing much of the specification of language in the LAD. The assumption is that the characteristic structure of language is somehow coded genetically. The effect of language evolution on the cultural substrate, in the absence of genetic change, is not addressed by this explanation. We show that the poverty of the stimulus introduces a pressure for compositional language structure when we consider language evolution resulting from iterated observational learning. We use a mathematical model to map the space of parameters that result in compositional syntax.

We investigated how introducing the potential for mutualistic relationships (where the presence of one type of organism stimulates the growth of another type, and vice versa) affected the evolutionary dynamics of the system. Without this potential, one or a small number of individual types of organisms dominated the simulated community from the onset. When mutualistic relationships were allowed, many persisting types arose, with new types appearing continually. Furthermore, we investigated how the stability of the community differed when mutualistic relationships were allowed and disallowed. Our results suggest that the existence of mutualistic relationships improved community stability.","2002-01","2021-08-04 16:19:29","2021-08-04 16:19:29","2021-08-04 16:19:29","5-24","","1","8","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a previous article we explored the dynamics of markets from a psychological perspective using a multi-agent simulation model. The main results indicated that the behavioral rules dominating the artificial consumer's decision making determine the resulting market dynamics, such as fashions, lock-in, and unstable renewal. Results also show the importance of psychological variables like social networks, preferences, and the need for identity to explain the dynamics of markets. In this article we extend this work in two directions. First, we will focus on a more systematic investigation of the effects of different network structures. The previous article was based on Watts and Strogatz's approach, which describes the small-world and clustering characteristics in networks. More recent research demonstrated that many large networks display a scale-free power-law distribution for node connectivity. In terms of market dynamics this may imply that a small proportion of consumers may have an exceptional influence on the consumptive behavior of others (hubs, or early adapters). We show that market dynamics is a self-organized property depending on the interaction between the agents' decision-making process (heuristics), the product characteristics (degree of satisfaction of unit of consumption, visibility), and the structure of interactions between agents (size of network and hubs in a social network).","2003-10","2021-08-04 16:18:07","2021-08-04 16:18:07","2021-08-04 16:18:07","343-356","","4","9","","Artificial Life","Simulating Market Dynamics","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\4RISCF5P\Janssen and Jager - 2003 - Simulating Market Dynamics Interactions between C.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesized that transient single allele inactivation of an autosomal gene during gametogenesis or very early embryogenesis could have a selective advantage if it permits the functional sampling of each allele and precludes committing maternal effort to an embryo with a deleterious mutation. To test this hypothesis, we simulated the evolution of gene expression activation and deactivation rates and imposed two different selective pressures on the populations: (a) late selection against individuals that cannot maintain a threshold level of gene product that occurs after the investment of maternal effort (i.e., after birth); or (b) early selection: in addition to late selection, maintenance of the gene product above a threshold level was necessary for early development prior to commitment of maternal effort. We found that the opportunity to save reproductive effort from early selection caused the evolution of higher deactivation rates and lower activation rates than in the late selection condition. Thus, we predict that in the special case where early selection can save maternal investment in non-viable offspring, gene expression activation rates and deactivation rates might be selected to permit sampling of the product from each allele.","2003-07","2021-08-04 16:17:09","2021-08-04 16:17:09","2021-08-04 16:17:09","317-326","","3","9","","Artificial Life","Selective Instability","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article we present a simple step-by-step route to assemble a proto-organism. Many pictures have been proposed to describe this transition within the origins-of-life and artificial life communities, and more recently alternative pictures have been emerging from advances in nanoscience and biotechnology. The proposed proto-organism lends itself to both traditions and defines a new picture based on a simple idea: Given a set of required functionalities, minimize the physicochemical structures that support these functionalities, and make sure that all structures self-assemble and mutually enhance each other's existence. The result is the first concrete, rational design of a simple physicochemical system that integrates the key functionalities in a thermodynamically favorable manner as a lipid aggregate integrates proto-genes and a proto-metabolism. Under external pumping of free energy, the metabolic processes produce the required building blocks, and only specific gene sequences enhance the metabolic kinetics sufficiently for the whole system to survive. We propose an experimental implementation of the proto-organism with a discussion of our experimental results, together with relevant results produced by other experimental groups, and we specify what is still missing experimentally. Identifying the missing steps is just as important as providing the road map for the transition. We derive the kinetic and thermodynamic conditions of each of the proto-organism subsystems together with relevant theoretical and computational results about these subsystems. We present and discuss detailed 3D simulations of the lipid aggregation processes. From the reaction kinetics we derive analytical aggregate size distributions, and derive key properties of the metabolic efficiency and stability. Thermodynamics and kinetics of the ligation directed self-replication of the proto-genes is discussed, and we summarize the full life cycle of the proto-organism by comparing size, replication time, and energy with the biomass efficiency of contemporary unicells. Finally, we also compare our proto-organism picture with existing origins-of-life and protocell pictures.             By assembling one possible bridge between nonliving and living matter we hope to provide a piece in the ancient puzzle about who we are and where we come from.","2003-07","2021-08-04 16:17:04","2021-08-04 16:17:04","2021-08-04 16:17:04","269-316","","3","9","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to meet this challenge, many researchers are proposing indirect encodings, that is, evolutionary mechanisms where the same genes are used multiple times in the process of building a phenotype. Such gene reuse allows compact representations of very complex phenotypes. Development is a natural choice for implementing indirect encodings, if only because nature itself uses this very process. Motivated by the development of embryos in nature, we define artificial embryogeny (AE) as the subdiscipline of evolutionary computation (EC) in which phenotypes undergo a developmental phase. An increasing number of AE systems are currently being developed, and a need has arisen for a principled approach to comparing and contrasting, and ultimately building, such systems. Thus, in this paper, we develop a principled taxonomy for AE. This taxonomy provides a unified context for long-term research in AE, so that implementation decisions can be compared and contrasted along known dimensions in the design space of embryogenic systems. It also allows predicting how the settings of various AE parameters affect the capacity to efficiently evolve complex phenotypes.","2003-04","2021-08-04 16:15:25","2021-08-04 16:15:25","2021-08-04 16:15:25","93-130","","2","9","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These contribution values quantify the importance of each element to the tasks the agent performs. Here we present a generalization of the basic FCA to high-dimensional analysis, using high-order compound elements. Such elements are composed of conjunctions of simple elements. Their usage enables the explicit expression of sets of neurons or synapses whose contributions are interdependent, a prerequisite for localizing the function of complex neurocontrollers. High-dimensional FCA is shown to significantly improve on the accuracy of the basic analysis, to provide new insights concerning the main subsets of simple elements in the network that interact in a complex nonlinear manner, and to systematically reveal the types of interactions that characterize the evolved neurocontroller.","2003-01","2021-08-04 16:13:49","2021-08-04 16:13:49","2021-08-04 16:13:49","1-20","","1","9","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although cooperation in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) has been studied for over twenty years, most of this research has been focused on strategies that involve nonlearned behavior. Another approach is to suppose that players' selection of the preferred reply might be enforced in the same way as feeding animals track the best way to feed in changing nonstationary environments. Learning mechanisms such as operant conditioning enable animals to acquire relevant characteristics of their environment in order to get reinforcements and to avoid punishments. In this study, the role of operant conditioning in the learning of cooperation was evaluated in the PD. We found that operant mechanisms allow the learning of IPD play against other strategies. When random moves are allowed in the game, the operant learning model showed low sensitivity. On the basis of this evidence, it is suggested that operant learning might be involved in reciprocal altruism.","2004-09","2021-08-04 16:13:02","2021-08-04 16:13:02","2021-08-04 16:13:02","433-461","","4","10","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\8N6HUW57\Gutnisky and Zanutto - 2004 - Cooperation in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Is .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inspired by biological phenomena (bird flocking, fish schooling, etc.), particle systems have been used not only for biological modeling, but also increasingly for applications requiring the simulation of collective movements such as computer-generated animation. In this research, we take some first steps in extending particle systems so that they not only move collectively, but also solve simple problems. This is done by giving the individual particles (agents) a rudimentary intelligence in the form of a very limited memory and a top-down, goal-directed control mechanism that, triggered by appropriate conditions, switches them between different behavioral states and thus different movement dynamics. Such enhanced particle systems are shown to be able to function effectively in performing simulated search-and-collect tasks. Further, computational experiments show that collectively moving agent teams are more effective than similar but independently moving ones in carrying out such tasks, and that agent teams of either type that split off members of the collective to protect previously acquired resources are most effective. This work shows that the reflexive agents of contemporary particle systems can readily be extended to support goal-directed problem solving while retaining their collective movement behaviors. These results may prove useful not only for future modeling of animal behavior, but also in computer animation, coordinated movement control in robotic teams, particle swarm optimization, and computer games.","2004-09","2021-08-04 16:12:38","2021-08-04 16:12:38","2021-08-04 16:12:38","379-395","","4","10","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As such, they are fundamental structures for the theory of autopoiesis as originally formulated by Varela and Maturana. In particular, since self-reproduction is a very important feature of minimal cellular life, the study of self-reproduction of micelles and vesicles represents a quite challenging bio-mimetic approach. Our laboratory has put much effort in recent years into implementing self-reproduction of vesicles as models for self-reproduction of cellular bounded structures, and this article is a further contribution in this direction. In particular, we deal with the so-called matrix effect of vesicles, related to the fact that when fresh surfactant is added to an aqueous solution containing preformed vesicles of a very narrow size distribution, the newly formed vesicles (instead of being polydisperse, as is usually the case) have dimensions very close to those of the preformed ones. In practice, this corresponds to a mechanism of reproduction of vesicles of the same size. In this article, the matrix effect is re-elaborated in the perspective of the origin of life, and in particular in terms of the prebiotic mechanisms that might permit the growth and reproduction of vesicles. The data are analyzed by dynamic light scattering with a new program that permits the calculation of the number-weighted size distribution. It is shown that, on adding a stoichiometric amount of oleate micelles to preformed oleate vesicles extruded at 50 and 100 nm, the final distribution contains about twice the initial number of particles, centered around 50 and 100 nm. The same holds when oleate is added to preformed phospholipid liposomes. By contrast, when the same amount of oleate is added to an aqueous solution (as a control experiment), a very broad distribution ranging between 20 and 1000 nm is obtained. The data can then be seen as a kind of reproduction of the same size vesicles, and the argument is advanced that this may correspond to a simple prebiotic mechanism of vesicle multiplication in prebiotic times, when only physical forces might be responsible for the basic mechanisms of early protocell growth and division. Preliminary data also show that repeated addition of oleate maintains the same basic initial features, and that surfactants other than oleate also respect the reproductive mode of the matrix effect.","2004-06","2021-08-04 16:11:44","2021-08-04 16:11:44","2021-08-04 16:11:44","297-308","","3","10","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article presents the deployment of the concepts of autopoiesis in the field of immunology, a discipline where working biologists themselves spontaneously have long had recourse to “cognitive” metaphors: “recognition”; a “repertoire” of recognized molecular shapes; “learning” and “memory”; and, most striking of all, a “self versus non-self” distinction. It is shown that in immunology, the concepts of autopoiesis can be employed to generate clear novel hypotheses, models demonstrating these ideas, testable predictions, and novel therapeutic procedures. Epistemologically, it is shown that the self–non-self distinction, while quite real, is misleadingly named. When a real mechanism for generating this distinction is identified, it appears that the actual operational distinction is between (a) a sufficiently numerous set of initial antigens, present from the start of ontogeny, in conditions that allow for their participation in the construction of the system's organization and operation, and (b) single antigens that are first presented to the system after two successive phases of maturation. To call this a self–non-self distinction obscures the issue by presupposing what it ought to be the job of scientific investigation to explain.","2004-06","2021-08-04 16:11:31","2021-08-04 16:11:31","2021-08-04 16:11:31","261-276","","3","10","","Artificial Life","The Affirmation of Self","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Acknowledging the invaluable contribution of the autopoietic school to present biological thinking, we offer an alternative way of conceiving the most basic forms of autonomy. We give a bottom-up account of the origins of “self-production” (or self-construction, as we propose to call it), pointing out which are the minimal material and energetic requirements for the constitution of basic autonomous systems. This account is, indeed, committed to the project of developing a general theory of biology, but well grounded in the universal laws of physics and chemistry. We consider that the autopoietic theory was formulated in highly abstract terms and, in order to advance in the implementation of minimal autonomous systems (and, at the same time, make major progress in exploring the origins of life), a more specific characterization of minimal autonomous systems is required. Such a characterization will not be drawn from a review of the autopoietic criteria and terminology (à la Fleischaker) but demands a whole reformulation of the question: a proper naturalization of the concept of autonomy. Finally, we also discuss why basic autonomy, according to our account, is necessary but not sufficient for life, in contrast with Varela's idea that autopoiesis was a necessary and sufficient condition for it.","2004-06","2021-08-04 16:11:25","2021-08-04 16:11:25","2021-08-04 16:11:25","235-259","","3","10","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, only recently have some scientists begun to ask if computer viruses are not a form of artificial life—a self-replicating organism. Simply because computer viruses do not exist as organic molecules may not be sufficient reason to dismiss the classification of this form of “vandalware” as a form of life. This paper begins with a description of how computer viruses operate and their history, and of the various ways computer viruses are structured.

An extended design of mechanical conformational switches [16] is proposed that can encode several subassembly sequences. A particular subassembly sequence is generated due to conformational changes of parts during one-dimensional randomized assembly. The optimal subassembly sequence that maximizes the yield of a desired assembly can be found via genetic search over a space of parameterized conformational switch designs, rather than a space of subassembly sequences. The resulting switch design encodes the optimal subassembly sequence so that the desired assemblies are put together only in the optimal sequence. The results of genetic search and rate equation analyses reveal that the optimal subassembly sequence depends on the initial concentration of parts and the defect probabilities during randomized assembly. The results indicate that abundant parts and parts with high defect probabilities should be assembled earlier rather than later.","1995-07","2021-08-06 07:12:51","2021-08-06 07:12:51","2021-08-06 07:12:51","377-416","","4","2","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\NYA9B596\Saitou and Jakiela - 1995 - Subassembly Generation via Mechanical Conformation.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two unrelated problems—neural net learning and constraint satisfaction—are used to illustrate the approach. Both problems use predator-prey interactions to boost the search. In contrast with traditional “single population” genetic algorithms (GAs), two populations constantly interact and coevolve.             However, the same algorithm can also be used with different types of coevolutionary interactions. As an example, the symbiotic coevolution of solutions and genetic representations is shown to provide an elegant solution to the problem of finding a suitable genetic representation.             The approach presented here greatly profits from the partial and continuous nature of LTFE. Noise tolerance is one advantage. Even more important, LTFE is ideally suited to deal with coupled fitness landscapes typical for coevolution.","1995-07","2021-08-06 07:12:33","2021-08-06 07:12:33","2021-08-06 07:12:33","355-375","","4","2","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The variation in a reproduced tape is taken as mutation. Because this mutation is caused by a machine's program, we call it active mutation. Which machine is translated from a given tape is dependent on what kind of a machine reads the tape. External noise is introduced in a machine's reading process to make errors. A new reaction pathway is induced by external noise via a machine's error action. We find that the induced pathways will be mimicked deterministically in an emerging core structure. This core structure will remain stable after turning off external noise. Low external noise develops a core structure of a minimal self-replicative loop. When external noise is elevated, a more complex network evolves. Machines containing a complex core network, which has been bred in high external noise, will actively rewrite tapes rather than just replicate them.

In this article we begin by using the NKC model of coevolution to examine endosymbiosis and its effect on the evolutionary performance of the partners involved. We are then able to suggest the conditions under which endosymbioses are more likely to occur and why; we find they emerge between organisms within a window of their respective “chaotic gas regimes” and hence that the association represents a more stable state for the partners. The conditions under which gene transfer is more likely to represent an advantage for such endosymbionts are then examined within the same model. We find that, providing a suitable pathway exists, such a process can lead to a more efficient genetic configuration for the symbionts within a window that overlaps that in which endosymbioses occur.

Simulated plants carried defensive genes and herbivores carried genes coding for resistance (metabolism of herbivore defense) in gene-for-gene synchrony. Collectively these genes are referred to as defensive/resistance genes (DR-genes). Genes were linked on chromosomes. Regulatory genes modified both dominance at these DR loci and the tradeoff cost involved in producing either defense or resistance. We tested the effects of varying a) the number of DR-loci, b) the ratio of the number of herbivore:plant generations, c) the shape (square vs. long and thin) and function (torus vs. island) of the lattice, and d) herbivore encounter rate on plant progeny dispersal distance.             Increasing both the number of DR-genes and the ratio of herbivore:plant generations caused a tighter coevolutionary response between plants and herbivores. Plant defense was highly sensitive to herbivory but not to increasing encounter rates. Plant DR-genes were selectively disadvantageous with only one lucus but selectively favored with two or more loci. Increasing the number of herbivore:plant generations caused increased fluctuations in herbivore resistance gene frequencies and a decrease in the lag time in herbivore response to changes in plant defensive gene frequencies. The relationship between heterotroph and autotroph DR-genes increased exponentially with increasing numbers of DR-loci. This relationship suggests that autotrophs benefit from increased diversity of defense that causes a relative increase in cost for the heterotrophs. The shape of the lattice interacted with lattice function, resulting in high species persistence on wraparound habitats and the greatest extinction likelihood on rectangular islands.

The frequencies of genes coding for plant defense and herbivore resistance were dynamic for thousands of generations, despite the homogeneous lattice.

Then a new specialist strategy suddenly emerges with a preference for another food type present in the environment. The appearance of the new strategy takes very few generations, in fact much fewer than in a population starting from zero (random initial population) in the same environment. This, together with the fact that the population with an evolutionary past is more efficient than the population starting from zero, suggests that the former population is preadapted to the changed environment.

Mathematically defined as semi-algebraic sets, SANs involve geometric components that are submitted to two coupled processes: (a) the adjustment of the components (under the action of the learning examples), and (b) the regeneration of new components. Several examples of SANs are described, using different types of components. The geometric nature of SANs gives new possibilities for solving the bias/variance dilemma in discrimination or curve approximation problems.

This trend, together with the projected consequences of climate change, may prove to exacerbate substantially the significance of malaria in the coming decades.             In this article we introduce the use of an evolutionary modeling approach to simulate the adaptation of mosquitoes and parasites to the available pesticides and drugs. By coupling genetic algorithms with a dynamic malaria-epidemiological model, we derive a complex adaptive system capable of simulating adapting and evolving processes within both the mosquito and the parasite populations.             This approach is used to analyze malaria management strategies appropriate to regions of higher and lower degrees of endemicity. The results suggest that adequate use of insecticides and drugs may reduce the occurrence of malaria in regions of low endemicity, although increased efforts would be necessary in the event of a climate change. However, our model indicates that in regions of high endemicity the use of insecticides and drugs may lead to an increase in incidence due to enhanced resistance development. Projected climate change, on the other hand, may lead to a limited reduction of the occurrence of malaria due to the presence of a higher percentage of immune persons in the older age class.","1997-07","2021-08-06 07:07:19","2021-08-06 07:07:19","2021-08-06 07:07:19","213-236","","3","3","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Individuals are represented by circles with free range on a resource-producing plane. These circles grow allometrically with biomass of fixed resources. Resource acquisition behaviors include competition by area overlap for producers, and movement based on perception and intent. Individual-level energetics are explicitly modeled with inefficient assimilation, resource transformation, and allometrically specified metabolic costs. Individual growth and reproduction requires a history of successful resource acquisition. Terrestrial producer, herbivore, and carnivore species classes are included, extensible to further classes. A grassland food chain model of “plants,” “grasshoppers,” and “spiders” is used to demonstrate ecosystem-level results of given individual-level behaviors. Ecosystem-level behaviors include a trophic cascade of indirect carnivore-producer interaction effects; stable persistence of all populations; a near-realistic biomass pyramid; and spatial competition and coexistence of multiple producer species.

Each computer has a memory to store the machine instruction program, and when a program is executed, a series of machine codes in the memory is sequentially decoded, leading to register operations in the central processing unit (CPU). By means of these operations, the computer not only can handle its generally used registers but also can read and write the environmental database. Simulation is driven by genetic algorithms (GAs) performed on the population of program memories. Mutation and crossover create program diversity in the memory, and selection facilitates the reproduction of appropriate programs. Through these evolutionary operations, advantageous combinations of machine codes are created and fixed in the population one by one, and the higher function, which enables the computer to calculate an appropriate number from the environment, finally emerges in the program memory.             In the latter half of the article, the performance of GAs on this system is studied. Under different sets of parameters, the evolutionary speed, which is determined by the time until the domination of the final program, is examined and the conditions for faster evolution are clarified.

The characteristics of this artificial mode of evolution are immediacy, as opposed to Darwin's law of gradualism, transclass descent, unlike Darwin's common descent, identity, as opposed to variety, and an artificial rate of mutational change, as opposed to a natural one. It constitutes evolution out of evolution, and redoubles our ethical responsibility for the future.","1997-01","2021-08-06 07:04:49","2021-08-06 07:04:49","2021-08-06 07:04:49","51-61","","1","3","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As its name suggests, neural Darwinism is modeled after biological Darwinism, and its authors assert that the two processes are strongly analogous. Both operate on variation in a population, amplifying the more adaptive individuals. However, from a computational perspective, neural Darwinism is quite different from other models of natural selection, such as genetic algorithms. The individuals of neural Darwinism do not replicate, thus robbing the process of the capacity to explore new solutions over time and ultimately reducing it to a random search. Because neural Darwinism does not have the computational power of a truly Darwinian process, it is misleading to label it as such. To illustrate this disparity in adaptive power, one of Edelman's early computer experiments, Darwin I, is revisited, and it is shown that adding replication greatly improves the adaptive power of the system.","1997-01","2021-08-06 07:04:44","2021-08-06 07:04:44","2021-08-06 07:04:43","41-49","","1","3","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research was motivated by the desire to understand the basic information-processing principles underlying self-replication, the potential long-term applications of programmable self-replicating machines, and the possibility of gaining insight into biological replication and the origins of life. We view past research as taking three main directions: early complex universal computer-constructors modeled after Turing machines, qualitatively simpler self-replicating loops, and efforts to view self-replication as an emergent phenomenon. We discuss our recent studies in the latter category showing that self-replicating structures can emerge from nonreplicating components, and that genetic algorithms can be applied to program automatically simple but arbitrary structures to replicate. We also describe recent work in which self-replicating structures are successfully programmed to do useful problem solving as they replicate.

The resultant genotypephenotype mapping is degenerate in fitness space, there being no direct selective advantage for one probability versus another. Thus there is a “symmetry” between various genotypes that all correspond to the same phenotype. We show that the action of mutation and crossover lifts this degeneracy, that is, the genetic operators induce a breaking of the genotype-phenotype symmetry, thus leading to a preference for those genotypes that propagate most successfully into future generations.

The paddler is supposed to be a model of an animal that might exist, although it is perfectly possible to view it as a model of a robot that might be built. The agent is assumed to navigate in a simulated deep-sea environment, where it forages for autoluminescent prey. It uses a biologically inspired phototaxic foraging strategy, while paddling in a layer just above the bottom. The advantage of this living space is that the navigation problem—and hence our model—is essentially two-dimensional. Moreover, the deep-sea environment is physically simple (and hence easy to simulate): no significant currents, constant temperature, completely dark. A foraging performance metric is developed that circumvents the necessity to solve the traveling salesman problem. A parametric simulation study then quantifies the influence of habitat factors, such as the density of prey, and body geometry (e.g., placement, direction and directional selectivity of the eyes) on foraging success. Adequate performance proves to require a specific body geometry adapted to the habitat characteristics. In general, performance degrades gracefully for modest changes of the geometric and habitat parameters, indicating that we work in a stable region of “design space.” The parameters have to strike a compromise between, on the one hand, the ability to “fixate” an attractive target, and on the other hand, to “see” as many targets at the same time as possible. One important conclusion is that simple reflex-based navigation can be surprisingly efficient. Additionally, performance in a global task (foraging) depends strongly on local parameters such as visual direction tuning, position of the eyes and paddles, and so forth. Behavior and habitat “mold” the body, and the body geometry strongly influences performance. The resulting platform enables further testing of foraging strategies or vision and locomotion theories stemming either from biology or from robotics.","1998-04","2021-08-04 17:03:20","2021-08-04 17:03:20","2021-08-04 17:03:20","157-181","","2","4","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have made a robot model in which we implement a simple neural controller that is less complex than the controllers traditionally hypothesized for cricket phonotaxis and syllable rate preference. The simple controller, which had been successfully used with a slowed and simplified signal, is here demonstrated to function, using songs with identical parameters to those found in real male cricket song, using an analog electronic model of the peripheral auditory morphology of the female cricket as the sensor. We put the robot under the same experimental conditions as the female crickets, and it responds with phonotaxis to calling songs of real male Gryllus bimaculatus. Further, the robot only responds to songs with syllable rates within a bandwidth similar to the bandwidth found for crickets. By making polar plots of the heading direction of the robot, we obtain behavioral data that can be used in statistical analyses. These analyses show that there are statistically significant differences between the behavioral responses to calling songs with syllable rates within the bandwidth and calling songs with syllable rates outside the bandwidth. This gives the verification that the simple neural control mechanism (together with morphological auditory matched filtering) can account for the syllable rate preference found in female crickets. With our robot system, we can now systematically explore the mechanisms controlling recognition and choice behavior in the female cricket by experimental replication.","1998-01","2021-08-04 17:02:14","2021-08-04 17:02:14","2021-08-04 17:02:14","95-107","","1","4","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we present a new computational model in which each lipid is simulated by a more realistic amphiphilic particle consisting of a hydrophilic head and a long hydrophobic tail. The intermolecular interactions are approximated by a set of simple forces reflecting physical and chemical properties of lipids, for example, hydrophobicity and electrostatic forces, which are believed to be crucial for the formation of various aggregates. With a set of carefully selected parameters, this model is able to simulate successfully the formation of micelles in an aqueous environment and reversed micelle structures in an oil solvent from an initially randomly distributed set of lipidlike particles.             This model can be used to study, at the microscopic level, the self-assembly of different protocell structures in the evolutionary process and the impact of environmental conditions on the formation of these structures.

We consider only the simplest cases in which a broker sets its price and product parameters based solely on the system's current state, without explicit prediction of the future.

The experiment with evoloop met with the intriguing result that, though no mechanism was explicitly provided to promote evolution, the loops varied through direct interaction of their phenotypes, smaller individuals were naturally selected thanks to their quicker self-reproductive ability, and the whole population gradually evolved toward the smallest ones. This result gives a unique example of evolution of self-replicators where genotypical variation is caused by precedent phenotypical variation.

Internal states of agents are characterized by meaning vectors. Simple neural networks composed of one layer of hidden neurons perform cognitive activities of agents. An elementary communication act consists of the following: (a) two agents are selected, where one of them is declared the speaker and the other the listener; (b) the speaker codes a selected meaning vector onto a sequence of symbols and sends it to the listener as a message; and finally, (c) the listener decodes this message into a meaning vector and adapts his or her neural network such that the differences between speaker and listener meaning vectors are decreased. A Darwinian evolution enlarged by ideas from the Baldwin effect and Dawkins' memes is simulated by a simple version of an evolutionary algorithm without crossover. The agent fitness is determined by success of the mutual pairwise communications. It is demonstrated that agents in the course of evolution gradually do a better job of decoding received messages (they are closer to meaning vectors of speakers) and all agents gradually start to use the same vocabulary for the common communication. Moreover, if agent meaning vectors contain regularities, then these regularities are manifested also in messages created by agent speakers, that is, similar parts of meaning vectors are coded by similar symbol substrings. This observation is considered a manifestation of the emergence of a grammar system in the common coordinated communication.","1999-10","2021-08-04 17:00:51","2021-08-04 17:00:51","2021-08-04 17:00:51","319-342","","4","5","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Along with providing an introduction to Gaia theory, this article presents simulations of Gaian emergence based on an artificial-life model involving genetic algorithms and guilds of simple metabolizing agents. In these simulations, resource competition leads to guild diversity; the ensemble of guilds then manifests life-sustaining nutrient recycling and exerts distributed control over environmental nutrient ratios.

This paper suggests that some difficulties in current models could be avoided by taking account of “niche selection” as proposed by Waddington [21] and subsequent authors [2]. Computer simulations, in which an evolving population of artificial organisms “selects” the niche(s) that maximize their fitness, are compared with a Control Model in which “Niche Selection” is absent. In the simulations the Niche Selection Model consistently produced a greater number of “fit” organisms than the Control Model; although the Niche Selection Model tended, in general, to produce organisms occupying simple niches, it was nonetheless more effective than the Control Model in producing well-adapted organisms inhabiting complex niches. It is shown that the production of these organisms is critically dependent on the rate of environmental change: Slow change leads to fit but undifferentiated populations, dominated by organisms occupying simple niches; differentiated populations, including well-adapted organisms living in complex niches, require rates of environmental change lying just beyond a mathematically well-defined critical value. In simulation “Niche Selection,” unlike conventional “Natural Selection,” provides a permanent selective bias in favor of simplicity. This tendency is counterbalanced by statistical forces favoring shifts from rare “simple niches” to commoner niches of greater complexity. Fit organisms inhabiting complex niches only emerge in conditions where the rate of environmental change is high enough to avoid the concentration of the population in very simple niches, but slow enough to permit step-by-step adaptation to niches of gradually increasing complexity. This result appears to be robust to changes in simulation parameters and assumptions, and leads to interesting conjectures about the real world behavior of biological organisms (and other complex adaptive systems). It is suggested that some of these conjectures might be relatively easy to test.","1999-07","2021-08-04 17:00:19","2021-08-04 17:00:19","2021-08-04 17:00:19","271-289","","3","5","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inspired by the central pattern generators found in animals, we develop neural controllers that can produce the patterns of oscillations necessary for the swimming of a simulated lamprey.             This work is inspired by Ekeberg's neuronal and mechanical model of a lamprey [11] and follows experiments in which swimming controllers were evolved using a simple encoding scheme [25, 26]. Here, controllers are developed using an evolutionary algorithm based on the SGOCE encoding [31, 32] in which a genetic programming approach is used to evolve developmental programs that encode the growing of a dynamical neural network. The developmental programs determine how neurons located on a two-dimensional substrate produce new cells through cellular division and how they form efferent or afferent interconnections. Swimming controllers are generated when the growing networks eventually create connections to the muscles located on both sides of the rectangular substrate. These muscles are part of a two-dimensional mechanical simulation of the body of the lamprey in interaction with water.             The motivation of this article is to develop a method for the design of control mechanisms for animal-like locomotion. Such a locomotion is characterized by a large number of actuators, a rhythmic activity, and the fact that efficient motion is only obtained when the actuators are well coordinated. The task of the control mechanism is therefore to transform commands concerning the speed and direction of motion into the signals sent to the multiple actuators. We define a fitness function, based on several simulations of the controller with different commands settings, that rewards the capacity of modulating the speed and the direction of swimming in response to simple, varying input signals. Central pattern generators are thus evolved capable of producing the relatively complex patterns of oscillations necessary for swimming. The best solutions generate traveling waves of neural activity, and propagate, similarly to the swimming of a real lamprey, undulations of the body from head to tail propelling the lamprey forward through water. By simply varying the amplitude of two input signals, the speed and the direction of swimming can be modulated.","1999-07","2021-08-04 17:00:11","2021-08-04 17:00:11","2021-08-04 17:00:11","247-269","","3","5","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we study the relationship between learning and evolution in a simple abstract model, where neural networks capable of learning are evolved using genetic algorithms (GAs). Individuals try to maximize their life energy by learning certain rules that distinguish between two groups of materials: food and poison. The connective weights of individuals' neural networks undergo modification, that is, certain characters will be acquired, through their lifetime learning. By setting various rates for the heritability of acquired characters, which is a motive force of Lamarckian evolution, we observe adaptational processes of populations over successive generations. Paying particular attention to behaviors under changing environments, we show the following results. Populations with lower rates of heritability not only show more stable behavior against environmental changes, but also maintain greater adaptability with respect to such changing environments. Consequently, the population with zero heritability, that is, the Darwinian population, attains the highest level of adaptation to dynamic environments.","1999-07","2021-08-04 16:59:53","2021-08-04 16:59:53","2021-08-04 16:59:53","203-223","","3","5","","Artificial Life","Evolving Learnable Neural Networks Under Changing Environments with Various Rates of Inheritance of Acquired Characters","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A major mediating factor is stigmergy, the elicitation of specific environment-changing behaviors by the sensory effects of local environmental changes produced by previous behavior. A typical task involving stigmergic self-organization is brood sorting: Many ant species sort their brood so that items at similar stages of development are grouped together and separated from items at different stages of development. This article examines the operation of stigmergy and self-organization in a homogeneous group of physical robots, in the context of the task of clustering and sorting Frisbees of two different types. Using a behavioral rule set simpler than any yet proposed for ant sorting, and having no capacity for spatial orientation or memory, the robots are able to achieve effective clustering and sorting showing all the signs of self-organization. It is argued that the success of this demonstration is crucially dependent on the exploitation of real-world physics, and that the use of simulation alone to investigate stigmergy may fail to reveal its power as an evolutionary option for collective life forms.","1999-04","2021-08-04 16:59:25","2021-08-04 16:59:25","2021-08-04 16:59:25","173-202","","2","5","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\KA77BGMR\Holland and Melhuish - 1999 - Stigmergy, Self-Organization, and Sorting in Colle.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a situation in which many individuals contribute to a collective effort, such as building a nest, stimuli provided by the emerging structure itself can provide a rich source of information for the working insects. The current article provides a detailed review of this stigmergic paradigm in the building behavior of paper wasps to show how stigmergy influenced the understanding of mechanisms and evolution of a particular biological system.

When installed on a domestic computer (PC or Macintosh), each Creatures CD-ROM creates a virtual world in which autonomous software agents exist. The agents, known as “norns,” interact with the human user, with each other, and with objects in their virtual world. Each norn coordinates perception and action via its own modular recurrent neural network: Each network has Hebbian learning, plus diffuse modulation of activity via a “hormonal” system that is part of that norn's “biochemistry.” Details of each norn's neural network and biochemistry are genetically specified, and norns can breed via sexual reproduction. In the reproduction process, genetic material may be mutated and may also be subjected to “gene duplications” that enable potentially unlimited increases in complexity of the norns' design. Over 500,000 Creatures CD-ROMS have now been sold. As each installed copy of Creatures can support 5 to 10 simultaneously existing individual norns, it seems reasonable to estimate that there are up to 5 million norns existing in the “cyberspace” provided by the global Creatures user community. Continued growth of the global norn population, to figures measured in tens of millions, is quite likely. Although a commercial product, the Creatures digital ecosystem should be of interest to artificial life scientists: There are obvious parallels with Yaeger's Poly World and Ray's Net Tierra systems.

The model consists of tiles of various shapes that stand for molecules. The chemical reaction, induced by the collisions of tiles, is represented by the change of the tile shapes. The rules for reaction are deterministic, and the evolution of the system strongly depends on mutual spatial relationship among tiles. The evolution often leads to self-organization of a “factory,” a set of tiles that produces tiles continuously and keeps its structure. Several interesting phenomena, such as a deformation or a division of a factory, are also observed. It is proposed that the formation of the factory is due to the interference between different aspects of tiles—the shape and the motion.

Adaptively significant genotypes trace a salient line or “wave” in these graphs. The quality of these waves indicates a variety of evolutionary phenomena, such as competitive exclusion, neutral variation, and random genetic drift.

First, comparisons in evolutionary performance are made between simulations of unicellular organisms and very simple multicellular-like organisms, under varying conditions. The results show that such multicellularity without differentiation appears selectively neutral, but that differentiation to soma (nonreproductives) proves beneficial as the amount of epistasis in the fitness landscape increases. This is explained by considering mutations in the generation of daughter cells and their subsequent effect on the propagule's fitness. This is interpreted as a simple example of the Baldwin effect. Second, the correspondences between multicellularity and eusociality are highlighted, particularly that both contain individuals who do not reproduce. The same process is then used to explain the emergence of eusocial colonies.","1999-01","2021-08-04 16:58:02","2021-08-04 16:58:02","2021-08-04 16:58:02","1-15","","1","5","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, he put it aside in 1953, apparently due to pressure of other work. Due to his tragically early death in 1957, he was never to return to it. The draft manuscript was eventually edited, and combined for publication with some related lecture transcripts, by Burks in 1966. It is clear from the time and effort that von Neumann invested in it that he considered this to be a very significant and substantial piece of work. However, subsequent commentators (beginning even with Burks) have found it surprisingly difficult to articulate this substance. Indeed, it has since been suggested that von Neumann's results in this area either are trivial, or, at the very least, could have been achieved by much simpler means. It is an enigma. In this paper I review the history of this debate (briefly) and then present my own attempt at resolving the issue by focusing on an analysis of von Neumann's problem situation. I claim that this reveals the true depth of von Neumann's achievement and influence on the subsequent development of this field, and further that it generates a whole family of new consequent problems, which can still serve to inform—if not actually define—the field of artificial life for many years to come.","2000-10","2021-08-04 16:57:22","2021-08-04 16:57:22","2021-08-04 16:57:22","347-361","","4","6","","Artificial Life","John von Neumann and the Evolutionary Growth of Complexity","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We calculate the probability of developing cancer under a set of simplifying assumptions and then elaborate these calculations, culminating in a simple simulation of the cell dynamics. The agent-based model allows us to examine the interactions of mutations critical for the development of cancer that are either evolutionarily neutral or selective. We can also examine the interaction of these mutations with a “mutator phenotype” derived from mutations that raise the mutation rate for the entire cell. The simulations suggest that there must be at least two selectively neutral mutations necessary for the development of cancer and that preventive treatments will be most effective when they increase this number. The model also suggests that selective mutations facilitate the development of cancer, so that the more selective mutations necessary for the development of cancer, the greater the chance of developing it.","2000-10","2021-08-04 16:57:16","2021-08-04 16:57:16","2021-08-04 16:57:16","325-345","","4","6","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The closed-loop interaction between brain and robot generates autonomous behaviors whose features are strictly related to the structure and operation of the neural preparation.

We propose the following theory: the differentiation of physiological states of a cell allows for a choice of enzymes, and this choice is later fixed genetically through evolution. To demonstrate this theory, a dynamical systems model consisting of the concentrations of metabolites, enzymes, amino acyl tRNA synthetase, and tRNA–amino acid complexes in a cell is introduced and studied numerically. It is shown that the biochemical states of cells are differentiated by cell-cell interactions, and each differentiated type starts to use a different synthetase. Through the mutation of genes, this difference in the genetic code is amplified and stabilized. The relevance of this theory to the evolution of non-universal genetic code in mitochondria is suggested. The present theory is based on our recent theory of isologous symbiotic speciation, which is briefly reviewed. According to the theory, phenotypes of organisms are first differentiated into distinct types through the interaction and developmental dynamics, even though they have identical genotypes; later, with mutation in the genotype, the genotype also differentiates into discrete types, while maintaining the “symbiotic” relationship between the types.

A genetic algorithm is used to evolve multi-agent languages for the predator agents in a version of the predator-prey pursuit problem. We show that the resulting behavior of the communicating multi-agent system is equivalent to that of a Mealy finite state machine whose states are determined by the agents' usage of the evolved language. Simulations show that the evolution of a communication language improves the performance of the predators. Increasing the language size (and thus increasing the number of possible states in the Mealy machine) improves the performance even further. Furthermore, the evolved communicating predators perform significantly better than all previous work on similar prey. We introduce a method for incrementally increasing the language size, which results in an effective coarse-to-fine search that significantly reduces the evolution time required to find a solution. We present some observations on the effects of language size, experimental setup, and prey difficulty on the evolved Mealy machines. In particular, we observe that the start state is often revisited, and incrementally increasing the language size results in smaller Mealy machines. Finally, a simple rule is derived that provides a pessimistic estimate on the minimum language size that should be used for any multi-agent problem.","2000-07","2021-08-04 16:55:54","2021-08-04 16:55:54","2021-08-04 16:55:54","237-254","","3","6","","Artificial Life","Talking Helps","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a version of the NKCS model we examine the effects of increasing the rate of meme evolution in relation to the rate of gene evolution, for various degrees of interdependence between the two replicators. That is, the effects of memes' (suggested) more rapid rate of evolution in comparison to that of genes is investigated using a tunable model of coevolution. It is found that, for almost any degree of interdependence between the two replicators, as the rate of meme evolution increases, a phase transition-like dynamic occurs under which memes have a significantly detrimental effect on the evolution of genes, quickly resulting in the cessation of effective gene evolution. Conversely, the memes experience a sharp increase in benefit from increasing their rate of evolution. We then examine the effects of enabling genes to reduce the percentage of gene-detrimental evolutionary steps taken by memes. Here a critical region emerges as the comparative rate of meme evolution increases, such that if genes cannot effectively select memes a high percentage of the time, they suffer from meme evolution as if they had almost no selective capability.","2000-07","2021-08-04 16:55:47","2021-08-04 16:55:47","2021-08-04 16:55:47","227-235","","3","6","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The raid patterns of three army ant species, Eciton hamatum, Eciton burchelli, and Eciton rapax, are analyzed. The respective diets of these species involve large but rare, small but common, and a combination of large but rare and small but common food sources. Using a model proposed by Deneubourg et al. [4], we simulate the formation of raid patterns in response to different food distributions. Our results indicate that the empirically observed raid patterns maximize return on investment, that is, the amount of food brought back to the nest per unit of energy expended, for each of the diets. Moreover, the values of the parameters that characterize the three optimal pattern-generating mechanisms are strikingly similar. Therefore the same behavioral rules at the individual level can produce optimal colony-level patterns.

The grammar of a language can be viewed as such a schema or theory. In a prior study [Teal et al., 1999] we proposed several conjectures about the learning and evolution of language that should follow from these observations: (C1) compression aids in generalization; (C2) compression occurs more easily in a “smooth”, as opposed to a “rugged”, problem space; and (C3) constraints from compression make it likely that natural languages evolve towards smooth string spaces. This previous work found general, if not complete support for these three conjectures. Here we build on that study to clarify the relationship between Minimum Description Length (MDL) and error in our model and examine evolution of certain languages in more detail. Our results suggest a fourth conjecture: that all else being equal, (C4) more complex languages change more rapidly during evolution.","2000-04","2021-08-04 16:54:46","2021-08-04 16:54:46","2021-08-04 16:54:46","129-143","","2","6","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is commonly believed, for example, that there is a large-scale trend in evolution towards increasing complexity, but empirical and theoretical arguments undermine this belief. Natural selection results in organisms that are well adapted to their local environments, but it is not clear how local adaptation can produce a global trend. In this paper, I present a simple computational model, in which local adaptation to a randomly changing environment results in a global trend towards increasing evolutionary versatility. In this model, for evolutionary versatility to increase without bound, the environment must be highly dynamic. The model also shows that unbounded evolutionary versatility implies an accelerating evolutionary pace. I believe that unbounded increase in evolutionary versatility is a large-scale trend in evolution. I discuss some of the testable predictions about organismal evolution that are suggested by the model.","2000-04","2021-08-04 16:54:24","2021-08-04 16:54:24","2021-08-04 16:54:24","109-128","","2","6","","Artificial Life","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\imy20\Zotero\storage\AGGRKM2W\Turney - 2000 - A Simple Model of Unbounded Evolutionary Versatili.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We focus on a class of embodied agents known as voxel-based soft robots (VSRs). They are aggregations of elastic blocks of soft material; as such, their morphologies are intrinsically modular. Nevertheless, controllers used until now for VSRs act as abstract, disembodied processing units: Disassembling such controllers for the purpose of module transferability is a challenging problem. Thus, the full potential of modularity for VSRs still remains untapped. In this work, we propose a novel self-organizing, embodied neural controller for VSRs. We optimize it for a given task and morphology by means of evolutionary computation: While evolving, the controller spreads across the VSR morphology in a way that permits emergence of modularity. We experimentally investigate whether such a controller (i) is effective and (ii) allows tuning of its degree of modularity, and with what kind of impact. To this end, we consider the task of locomotion on rugged terrains and evolve controllers for two morphologies. Our experiments confirm that our self-organizing, embodied controller is indeed effective. Moreover, by mimicking the structural modularity observed in biological neural networks, different levels of modularity can be achieved. Our findings suggest that the self-organization of modularity could be the basis for an automatic pipeline for assembling, disassembling, and reassembling embodied agents. © MIT Press Journals.

We put this hypothesis to test in a system of evolving foraging agents controlled by neural networks that can adapt the agents’ dynamical regime throughout evolution. Surprisingly, we find that all populations that discover solutions evolve to be subcritical. By a resilience analysis, we find that there are still benefits of starting the evolution in the critical regime. Namely, initially critical agents maintain their fitness level under environmental changes (for example, in the lifespan) and degrade gracefully when their genome is perturbed. At the same time, initially subcritical agents, even when evolved to the same fitness, are often inadequate to withstand the changes in the lifespan and degrade catastrophically with genetic perturbations. Furthermore, we find the optimal distance to criticality depends on the task complexity. To test it we introduce a hard task and a simple task: For the hard task, agents evolve closer to criticality, whereas more subcritical solutions are found for the simple task. We verify that our results are independent of the selected evolutionary mechanisms by testing them on two principally different approaches: a genetic algorithm and an evolutionary strategy. In summary, our study suggests that although optimal behaviour in the simple task is obtained in a subcritical regime, initializing near criticality is important to be efficient at finding optimal solutions for new tasks of unknown complexity. © 2022 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","2022","2023-07-06 10:30:21","2023-07-06 10:30:26","","458-478","","4","28","","Artif.

In this article, we use an existing Turing test for crowds to identify realistic features of real crowds that are generally omitted from simulation models. Our previous study using this test established that untrained individuals have difficulty in classifying movies of crowds as real or simulated, and that such people often have an idealised view of how crowds move. In this follow-up study (with new participants) we perform a second trial, which now includes a training phase (showing participants movies of real crowds). We find that classification performance significantly improves after training, confirming the existence of features that allow participants to identify real crowds.

We propose a new competitive algorithm that produces long-term global progress by identifying and filtering out opportunistic variations, that is, variations leading to progress against current competitors and retrogression against other competitors. The efficacy of the method is validated on the coevolution of predator and prey robots, a classic problem that has been used in related researches.

Higher levels of negative supercoiling facilitate the opening of the DNA double helix at gene promoters and thereby increase gene transcription rates. Different levels of supercoiling have been measured in bacteria exposed to different environments, leading to the hypothesis that variations in supercoiling could be a response to changes in the environment. Moreover, DNA transcription has been shown to generate local variations in the supercoiling level and, therefore, to impact the transcription rate of neighboring genes. In this work, we study the coupled dynamics of DNA supercoiling and transcription at the genome scale. We implement a genome-wide model of gene expression based on the transcription-supercoiling coupling. We show that, in this model, a simple change in global DNA supercoiling is sufficient to trigger differentiated responses in gene expression levels via the transcription-supercoiling coupling. Then, studying our model in the light of evolution, we demonstrate that this non-linear response to different environments, mediated by the transcription-supercoiling coupling, can serve as the basis for the evolution of specialized phenotypes. © 2022 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","2022","2023-07-06 10:30:22","2023-07-06 10:30:27","","440-457","","4","28","","Artif.

In turn, these resources frequently come distributed in patches or clusters. In the current work, we use an ecologically inspired agent-based model to investigate whether social search and clustering are stable outcomes of the dynamical mutual interactions between the two. While previous research has studied unidirectional influences of social search on resource clustering and vice versa, the current work investigates the consequential patterns emerging from their two-way interactions over time. In our model, consumers evolved search strategies (ranging from competitive to social) as adaptations to their environmental resource structures, and resources varied in distributions (ranging from random to clustered) that were shaped by agents’ consumption patterns. Across four experiments, we systematically analyzed the patterns of influence that search strategies and environment structure have on each other to identify stable attractor states of both. In Experiment 1, we fixed resource clustering at various levels and observed its influence on social search, and in Experiment 2, we observed the influence of social search on resource distribution. In both these experiments we found that increasing levels of one variable produced increases in the other; however, at very high levels of the manipulated variable, the dependent variable tended to fall. Finally in Experiments 3 and 4, we studied the dynamics that arose when resource clustering and social search could both change and mutually influence each other, finding that low levels of social search and clustering were stable attractor states. Our simple 2D model yielded results that qualitatively resemble those across a wide range of search domains (from physical search for food to abstract search for information), highlighting some stable outcomes of mutually interacting consumer/resource systems. © 2022 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","2023","2023-07-06 10:30:22","2023-07-06 10:30:27","","118-140","","1","29","","Artif.

In silico, data-driven models build, adapt, and improve representations of the target system using real-world experimental data. By simulating huge numbers of virtual robots using these data-driven models, optimization algorithms can illuminate multiple design candidates for transference to the real world. In reality, large-scale physical experimentation facilitates the fabrication, testing, and analysis of multiple candidate designs. Automated assembly and reconfigurable modular systems enable significantly higher numbers of real-world design evaluations than previously possible. Large volumes of ground-truth data gathered via physical experimentation can be returned to the virtual environment to improve data-driven models and guide optimization. Grounding the design process in physical experimentation ensures that the complexity of virtual robot designs does not outpace the model limitations or available fabrication technologies.

Simplified, it means “you help me; therefore somebody else will help you” (in contrast to direct reciprocity: “you help me; therefore I will help you”). Indirect reciprocity can be achieved via reputation and norms. Strategies, such as the so-called leading eight, relying on these principles can maintain high levels of cooperation and remain stable against invasion, even in the presence of errors. However, this is only the case if the reputation of an agent is modeled as a shared public opinion. If agents have private opinions and hence can disagree as to whether somebody is good or bad, even rare errors can cause cooperation to break apart. We show that most strategies can overcome the private assessment problem by applying pleasing. A pleasing agent acts in accordance with othersʼ expectations of their behaviour (i.e., pleasing them) instead of being guided by their own, private assessment. As such, a pleasing agent can achieve a better reputation than previously considered strategies when there is disagreement in the population. Pleasing is effective even if the opinions of only a few other individuals are considered and when it bears additional costs. Finally, through a more exhaustive analysis of the parameter space than previous studies, we show that some of the leading eight still function under private assessment, i.e., that cooperation rates are well above an objective baseline. Yet, pleasing strategies supersede formerly described ones and enhance cooperation. © 2021 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","2022","2023-07-06 10:30:22","2023-07-06 10:30:27","","246-276","","","27","","Artif.

We present a novel classification method applicable to any class of deterministic discrete space and time dynamical systems. The method is based on classifying the asymptotic behavior of the average computation time in a given system before entering a loop. We were able to identify a critical region of behavior that corresponds to a phase transition from ordered behavior to chaos across various classes of dynamical systems. To show that our approach can be applied to many different computational systems, we demonstrate the results of classifying cellular automata, Turing machines, and random Boolean networks. Further, we use this method to classify 2D cellular automata to automatically find those with interesting, complex dynamics. We believe that our work can be used to design systems in which complex structures emerge.

Lexicase selection, by contrast, selects on the basis of performance on random sequences of training cases; this has been shown to enhance problem-solving power in many circumstances. Lexicase selection can also be seen as better reflecting biological evolution, by modeling sequences of challenges that organisms face over their lifetimes. Recent work has demonstrated that the advantages of lexicase selection can be amplified by down-sampling, meaning that only a random subsample of the training cases is used each generation. This can be seen as modeling the fact that individual organisms encounter only subsets of the possible environments and that environments change over time. Here we provide the most extensive benchmarking of down-sampled lexicase selection to date, showing that its benefits hold up to increased scrutiny. The reasons that down-sampling helps, however, are not yet fully understood. Hypotheses include that down-sampling allows for more generations to be processed with the same budget of program evaluations; that the variation of training data across generations acts as a changing environment, encouraging adaptation; or that it reduces overfitting, leading to more general solutions. We systematically evaluate these hypotheses, finding evidence against all three, and instead draw the conclusion that down-sampled lexicase selectionʼs main benefit stems from the fact that it allows the evolutionary process to examine more individuals within the same computational budget, even though each individual is examined less completely. © 2021 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","2022","2023-07-06 10:30:22","2023-07-06 10:30:27","","183-203","","","27","","Artif.

Whilst white noise has the advantages of being simply generated and analytically tractable, empirical analyses demonstrate that most real environmental time series have power spectral densities consistent with pink or red noise, in which lower frequencies contribute proportionally greater amplitudes than higher frequencies. Simulated white noise environments may therefore fail to capture key components of real environmental time series, leading to erroneous results. To explore the effects of different noise colours on evolving populations, a simple evolutionary model of the interaction between life-history and the specialism-generalism axis was developed. Simulations were conducted using a range of noise colours as the environments to which agents adapted. Results demonstrate complex interactions between noise colour, reproductive rate, and the degree of evolved generalism; importantly, contradictory conclusions arise from simulations using white as opposed to red noise, suggesting that noise colour plays a fundamental role in generating adaptive responses. These results are discussed in the context of previous research on evolutionary responses to fluctuating environments, and it is suggested that Artificial Life as a field should embrace a wider spectrum of coloured noise models to ensure that results are truly representative of environmental and evolutionary dynamics. © 2021 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","2022","2023-07-06 10:30:22","2023-07-06 10:30:27","","164-182","","","27","","Artif.

The challenge we address here is to provide a structure for organizing this large family, to make it easier to find interesting automata, and to understand the relations between automata. Packard and Wolfram (1985) divided the family into four classes, based on the observed behaviors of the rules. Eppstein (2010) proposed an alternative four-class system, based on the forms of the rules. Instead of a class-based organization, we propose a continuous high-dimensional vector space, where each automaton is represented by a point in the space. The distance between two automata in this space corresponds to the differences in their behavioral characteristics. Nearest neighbors in the space have similar behaviors. This space should make it easier for researchers to see the structure of the family of semi-totalistic rules and to find the hidden gems in the family. © 2021 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","2021","2023-07-06 10:30:22","2023-07-06 10:30:27","","62-71","","1","27","","Artif.

Many take these facts as calls for a radical shift in our values and turn to questions about AI ethics, rights, and personhood. While the discussion of agency and rights is not wrong in principle, it is a form of misdirection in the current circumstances. Questions about an artificial agency can only come after a genuine reconciliation of human interactivity, creativity, and embodiment. This kind of challenge has both moral and theoretical force.

These two processes, the basis of much of life on earth, interact in many non-trivial ways, but their temporal hierarchy—evolution overarching development—is observed for most multicellular life forms. When designing robots, however, this tenet lifts: It becomes—however natural—a design choice. We propose to inverse this temporal hierarchy and design a developmental process happening at the phylogenetic timescale. Over a classic evolutionary search aimed at finding good gaits for tentacle 2D robots, we add a developmental process over the robots’ morphologies. Within a generation, the morphology of the robots does not change. But from one generation to the next, the morphology develops. Much like we become bigger, stronger, and heavier as we age, our robots are bigger, stronger, and heavier with each passing generation. Our robots start with baby morphologies, and a few thousand generations later, end-up with adult ones. We show that this produces better and qualitatively different gaits than an evolutionary search with only adult robots, and that it prevents premature convergence by fostering exploration. In addition, we validate our method on voxel lattice 3D robots from the literature and compare it to a recent evolutionary developmental approach.

Despite the long history of research on molecular mechanisms, many questions remain about algorithms by which cells can cooperate towards the same invariant morphogenetic outcomes. Therefore, conceptual frameworks are needed not only for motivating hypotheses for advancing the understanding of regeneration processes in living organisms, but also for regenerative medicine and synthetic biology. Inspired by planarian regeneration, this study offers a novel generic conceptual framework that hypothesizes mechanisms and algorithms by which cell collectives may internally represent an anatomical target morphology towards which they build after damage. Further, the framework contributes a novel nature-inspired computing method for self-repair in engineering and robotics. Our framework, based on past in vivo and in silico studies on planaria, hypothesizes efficient novel mechanisms and algorithms to achieve complete and accurate regeneration of a simple in silico flatwormlike organism from any damage, much like the body-wide immortality of planaria, with minimal information and algorithmic complexity. This framework that extends our previous circular tissue repair model integrates two levels of organization: tissue and organism. In Level 1, three individual in silico tissues (head, body, and tail—each with a large number of tissue cells and a single stem cell at the centre) repair themselves through efficient local communications. Here, the contribution extends our circular tissue model to other shapes and invests them with tissue-wide immortality through an information field holding the minimum body plan. In Level 2, individual tissues combine to form a simple organism. Specifically, the three stem cells form a network that coordinates organism-wide regeneration with the help of Level 1. Here we contribute novel concepts for collective decision-making by stem cells for stem cell regeneration and large-scale recovery. Both levels (tissue cells and stem cells) represent networks that perform simple neural computations and form a feedback control system. With simple and limited cellular computations, our framework minimises computation and algorithmic complexity to achieve complete recovery. We report results from computer simulations of the framework to demonstrate its robustness in recovering the organism after any injury. This comprehensive hypothetical framework that significantly extends the existing biological regeneration models offers a new way to conceptualise the information-processing aspects of regeneration, which may also help design living and non-living self-repairing agents. © 2021 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","2021","2023-07-06 10:30:22","2023-07-06 10:30:28","","80-104","","2","27","","Artif.

The late English mathematician, John Horton Conway, developed his illustrious Game of Life (Life) CA in 1970, which has since remained one of the most quintessential CA constructions—capable of producing a myriad of complex dynamic patterns and computational universality. Life and several other Life-like rules have been classified in the same group of aesthetically and dynamically interesting CA rules characterized by their complex behaviors. However, a rigorous quantitative comparison among similarly classified Life-like rules has not yet been fully established. Here we show that Life is capable of maintaining as much complexity as similar rules while remaining the most parsimonious. In other words, Life contains a consistent amount of complexity throughout its evolution, with the least number of rule conditions compared to other Life-like rules. We also found that the complexity of higher density Life-like rules, which themselves contain the Life rule as a subset, form a distinct concave density-complexity relationship whereby an optimal complexity candidate is proposed. Our results also support the notion that Life functions as the basic ingredient for cultivating the balance between structure and randomness to maintain complexity in 2D CA for low-and high-density regimes, especially over many iterations.

In this article, we address the problem of emergent cognitive capabilities and, more crucially, of their detection, by relying on co-evolving creatures with mutable morphology and neural structure. The former is implemented via both static and mobile structures whose shapes are controlled by cubic splines. The latter uses ESHyperNEAT to discover not only appropriate combinations of connections and weights but also to extrapolate hidden neuron distribution. The creatures integrate low-level perceptions (touch/pain proprioceptors, retina-based vision, frequency-based hearing) to inform their actions. By discovering a functional mapping between individual neurons and specific stimuli, we extract a high-level module-based abstraction of a creature’s brain. This drastically simplifies the discovery of relationships between naturally occurring events and their neural implementation. Applying this methodology to creatures resulting from solitary and tag-team co-evolution showed remarkable dynamics such as range-finding and structured communication. Such discovery was made possible by the abstraction provided by the modular ANN which allowed groups of neurons to be viewed as functionally enclosed entities. © 2022 Massachusetts Institute of Technology","2023","2023-07-06 10:30:23","2023-07-06 10:30:28","","66-93","","1","29","","Artif.

The main attractiveness of such systems is their flexibility, robustness, and scalability. An often overlooked yet promising feature is system modularity, which offers the possibility of harnessing agent specialization, while also enabling system-level upgrades. However, altering the agents’ capacities can change the exploration-exploitation balance required to maximize the system’s performance. Here, we study the effect of a swarm’s heterogeneity on its exploration-exploitation balance while tracking multiple fast-moving evasive targets under the cooperative multi-robot observation of multiple moving targets framework. To this end, we use a decentralized search and tracking strategy with adjustable levels of exploration and exploitation. By indirectly tuning the balance, we first confirm the presence of an optimal balance between these two key competing actions. Next, by substituting slower moving agents with faster ones, we show that the system exhibits a performance improvement without any modifications to the original strategy. In addition, owing to the additional amount of exploitation carried out by the faster agents, we demonstrate that a heterogeneous system’s performance can be further improved by reducing an agent’s level of connectivity, to favor the conduct of exploratory actions. Furthermore, in studying the influence of the density of swarming agents, we show that the addition of faster agents can counterbalance a reduction in the overall number of agents while maintaining the level of tracking performance. Finally, we explore the challenges of using differentiated strategies to take advantage of the heterogeneous nature of the swarm. © 2022 Massachusetts Institute of Technology","2023","2023-07-06 10:30:23","2023-07-06 10:30:28","","21-36","","1","29","","Artif.

One open question is determining which components and techniques to use in such a toolkit. To investigate this question, we employ agent-based AI, using simple computational substrates (i.e., digital brains) undergoing rapid evolution. Such systems are an ideal choice as they are fast to process, easy to manipulate, and transparent for analysis. Even in this limited domain, however, hundreds of different computational substrates are used. While benchmarks exist to compare the quality of different substrates, little work has been done to build broader theory on how substrate features interact. We propose a technique called the Comparative Hybrid Approach and develop a proof-of-concept by systematically analyzing components from three evolvable substrates: recurrent artificial neural networks, Markov brains, and Cartesian genetic programming. We study the role and interaction of individual elements of these substrates by recombining them in a piecewise manner to form new hybrid substrates that can be empirically tested. Here, we focus on network sparsity, memory discretization, and logic operators of each substrate. We test the original substrates and the hybrids across a suite of distinct environments with different logic and memory requirements. While we observe many trends, we see that discreteness of memory and the Markov brain logic gates correlate with high performance across our test conditions. Our results demonstrate that the Comparative Hybrid Approach can identify structural subcomponents that predict task performance across multiple computational substrates. © 2022 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","2022","2023-07-06 10:30:23","2023-07-06 10:30:29","","423-439","","4","28","","Artif.

Artificial chemistries are one of the most important tools for this purpose because they provide us with a basic framework to investigate under which conditions metabolisms capable of reproducing themselves, and ultimately, of evolving, can emerge. While there have been successful attempts at producing examples of emergent self-reproducing metabolisms, the set of rules involved remain too complex to shed much light on the underlying principles at work. In this article, we hypothesize that the key property needed for self-reproducing metabolisms to emerge is the existence of an autocatalyzed subset of Turing-complete reactions. We validate this hypothesis with a minimalistic artificial chemistry with conservation laws, which is based on a Turing-complete rewriting system called combinatory logic. Our experiments show that a single run of this chemistry, starting from a tabula rasa state, discovers—with no external intervention—a wide range of emergent structures including ones that self-reproduce in each cycle. All of these structures take the form of recursive algorithms that acquire basic constituents from the environment and decompose them in a process that is remarkably similar to biological metabolisms. © 2021 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","2022","2023-07-06 10:30:23","2023-07-06 10:30:29","","277-299","","","27","","Artif.

As is standard among models of artificial and biological neural networks, an analogue of the fully mature brain is presented as a blank slate. However, this does not consider the realities of biological development and developmental learning. Our purpose is to model the development of an artificial organism that exhibits complex behaviors. We introduce three alternate approaches to demonstrate how developmental embodied agents can be implemented. The resulting developmental Braitenberg vehicles (dBVs) will generate behaviors ranging from stimulus responses to group behavior that resembles collective motion. We will situate this work in the domain of artificial brain networks along with broader themes such as embodied cognition, feedback, and emergence. Our perspective is exemplified by three software instantiations that demonstrate how a BV-genetic algorithm hybrid model, a multisensory Hebbian learning model, and multi-agent approaches can be used to approach BV development. We introduce use cases such as optimized spatial cognition (vehicle-genetic algorithm hybrid model), hinges connecting behavioral and neural models (multisensory Hebbian learning model), and cumulative classification (multi-agent approaches).

A common method of evaluating the robustness of GRNs is to measure their ability to regulate a set of perturbed gene activation patterns back to their unperturbed forms. Usually, perturbations are obtained by collecting random samples produced by a predefined distribution of gene activation patterns. This sampling method introduces stochasticity, in turn inducing dynamicity. This dynamicity is imposed on top of an already complex fitness landscape. So where sampling is used, it is important to understand which effects arise from the structure of the fitness landscape, and which arise from the dynamicity imposed on it. Stochasticity of the fitness function also causes difficulties in reproducibility and in post-experimental analyses. We develop a deterministic distributional fitness evaluation by considering the complete distribution of gene activity patterns, so as to avoid stochasticity in fitness assessment. This fitness evaluation facilitates repeatability. Its determinism permits us to ascertain theoretical bounds on the fitness, and thus to identify whether the algorithm has reached a global optimum. It enables us to differentiate the effects of the problem domain from those of the noisy fitness evaluation, and thus to resolve two remaining anomalies in the behaviour of the problem domain of Espinosa-Soto and A.

The gates in the present work do not rely on obstacle flows or periodic boundary conditions, a significant improvement in terms of experimental realizability. Conductive heat transfer links can be used to connect the convective gates, and we demonstrate this with the example of binary half addition.

I contend that ubiquitous Artificial Intelligence (AI) and ML systems are close descendants of the Cartesian and Newtonian worldview in so far as they are tools that fundamentally sort, categorize, and classify the world, and forecast the future. Through the practice of clustering, sorting, and predicting human behaviour and action, these systems impose order, equilibrium, and stability to the active, fluid, messy, and unpredictable nature of human behaviour and the social world at large. Grounded in complexity science and enactive and embodied cognitive science approaches, this article emphasizes why people, embedded in social systems, are indeterminable and unpredictable.

In particular, a lot of research has been carried out on how the various evolutionary outcomes depend on the noise distributions representing the environmental changes, and how important it is for models to use inverse power-law distributions with the right noise colour. However, there are two distinct factors of relevance—the average total magnitude of change per unit time and the distribution of individual change magnitudes—and misleading results may emerge if those factors are not properly separated. This article makes use of an existing agent-based artificial life modeling framework to explore this issue using models previously tried and tested for other purposes. It begins by demonstrating how the total magnitude and distribution effects can easily be confused, and goes on to show how it is possible to untangle the influence of these interacting factors by using correlation-based normalization. It then presents a series of simulation results demonstrating that interesting dependencies on the noise distribution remain after separating those factors, but many effects involving the noise colour of inverse power-law distributions disappear, and very similar results arise across restricted-range white-noise distributions. The average total magnitude of change per unit time is found to have a substantial effect on the simulation outcomes, but the distribution of individual changes has very little effect. A robust counterexample is thereby provided to the idea that it is always important to use accurate environmental change distributions in artificial life models. © 2022 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","2022","2023-07-06 10:30:23","2023-07-06 10:30:30","","134-153","","1","28","","Artif.

Agents can be faced with complex fitness landscapes derived from multi-stage tasks, interaction with others, and limited environmental feedback. Agents that evolve to overcome these can sometimes access greater fitness, as a result of factors such as cooperation and tool use. However, it is often difficult to explain why evolutionary agents behave in certain ways, and what specific elements of the environment or task may influence the ability of evolution to find goal-achieving behaviours; even seemingly simple environments or tasks may contain features that affect agent evolution in unexpected ways. We explore principled simplification of evolutionary agent-based models, as a possible route to aiding their explainability. Using the River Crossing Task (RCT) as a case study, we draw on analysis in the Minimal River Crossing (RC-) Task testbed, which was designed to simplify the original task while keeping its key features. Using this method, we present new analysis concerning when agents evolve to successfully complete the RCT. We demonstrate that the RC-environment can be used to understand the effect that a cost to movement has on agent evolution, and that these findings can be generalised back to the original RCT. Then, we present new insight into the use of principled simplification in understanding evolutionary agents. We find evidence that behaviour dependent on features that survive simplification, such as problem structure, are amenable to prediction; while predicting behaviour dependent on features that are typically reduced in simplification, such as scale, can be invalid. © 2021 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","2022","2023-07-06 10:30:23","2023-07-06 10:30:30","","143-163","","","27","","Artif.

This article presents a novel and minimalistic biologically inspired search strategy inspired by bacterial chemotaxis and embodied intelligence concept: a concept stating that intelligent behaviour is a result of the interaction among the “brain,” body morphology including the sensory sensitivity tuned by the morphology, and the environment. Specifically, we present bacterial chemotaxis inspired searching behaviour with and without gradient information based on biological fluctuation framework: a mathematical framework that explains how biological creatures utilize noises in their behaviour. Via extensive simulation of a single sensor mobile robot that searches for a moving target, we will demonstrate how the effectiveness of the search depends on the sensory sensitivity and the inherent random walk strategies produced by the brain of the robot, comprising Ballistic, Levy, Brownian, and Stationary search.

In this article, we specify and implement a new algorithm for knowledge aggregation based on Nowak’s psychological theory Regulatory Theory of Social Influence (RTSI). This theory posits that social influence consists of not only sources trying to influence targets, but also targets seeking sources by whom to be influenced and learning what processing rules those sources are using. A multi-agent simulator SMARTSIS is implemented to evaluate the algorithm, using as its base scenario a linear public goods game where the DIP’s decision is a qualitative question of distributive justice. In a series of experiments examining the emergence of expertise, we show how RTSI enhances the effectiveness of the multi-agent DIP as a social group while conserving each agent’s individual resources. Additionally, we identify eight criteria for evaluating the DIP unit’s performance, consisting of four conflicting pairs of systemic drivers, and discuss how RTSI maintains a balanced tension between the four driver pairs through the emergence and divergence of expertise. We conclude by arguing that this shows how psychological theories like RTSI can have a crucial role in informing agent-based models of human behaviour, which in turn may be critically important for effective knowledge management and reflective self-improvement in both cyber-physical and socio-technical systems. © 2022 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","2023","2023-07-06 10:30:24","2023-07-06 10:30:30","","37-65","","1","29","","Artif.

He states that after choosing an indirect encoding of information, there are many more decisions to be made. The neuron is the key computational device within the brain, but it is not the only cell that participates in computations there. All approaches to create artificial neural networks (ANN) have focused on the neuron, but there are many types of neurons in the brain, and there are also many different types of neurons that are used as computational units. The two most common classes of computational neurons in use today are those with output values that are digital or those with inputs and outputs that are continuous, encoding a firing rate instead. The choice of neuron also influences what temporal scale is most important for the processing of sensory data. A digital neuron will produce a time series of firings from which it is possible to deduce a firing rate via averaging, while a continuous-value neuron encodes the firing rate directly. In this way, continuous-value encoding appears to be more efficient, but with a trade-off that can be costly if an organism has to react quickly to changing conditions.","2022","2023-07-06 10:30:24","2023-07-06 10:30:30","","157-166","","1","28","","Artif.

It has been known for several decades that such networks will form within systems of polymers (under cleavage and ligation reactions) under a simple process of random catalysis, and this process has since been mathematically analyzed. In this paper, we provide an exact expression for the expected number of self-sustaining autocatalytic networks that will form in a general chemical reaction system, and the expected number of these networks that will also be uninhibited (by some molecule produced by the system). Using these equations, we are able to describe the patterns of catalysis and inhibition that maximize or minimize the expected number of such networks.

Contemporary theory, however, treats it essentially as a static equilibrium system. Here we propose a formal framework to capture its complex, evolving natureWe develop an agent-based model of an economic system in which firms interact with each other and with consumers through market transactions. Production functions are represented by a pair of von Neumann technology matrices, and firms implement production plans taking into account current price levels for their inputs and output. Prices are determined by the relation between aggregate demand and supply. In the absence of exogenous perturbations the system fluctuates around its equilibrium state. New firms are introduced when profits are above normal, and are ultimately eliminated when losses persist. The varying number of firms represents a recurrent perturbation. The system thus exhibits dynamics at two levels: the dynamics of prices and output, and the dynamics of system size. The model aims to be realistic in its fundamental structure, but is kept simple in order to be computationally efficient. The ultimate aim is to use it as a platform for modeling the structural evolution of an economic system.

Evolved individuals have generalized across unique configurations of an overarching task. Here, we investigate the ability of Lexicase selection to generalize across multiple tasks, with each task again broken down into many instances. There are three objectives: to determine the feasibility of introducing additional tasks to the existing platform; to investigate any consequential effects of introducing these additional tasks during evolutionary adaptation; and to explore whether the schedule of presentation of the additional tasks over evolutionary time affects the final outcome. To address these aims we use a quadruped animat controlled by a feed-forward neural network with joint-angle, bearing-to-target, and spontaneous sinusoidal inputs. Weights in this network are trained using evolution with Lexicase-based parent selection. Simultaneous adaptation in a wall crossing task (labelled wall-cross) is explored when one of two different alternative tasks is also present: turn-and-seek or cargo-carry. Each task is parameterized into 100 distinct variants, and these variants are used as environments for evaluation and selection with Lexicase. We use performance in a single-task wall-cross environment as a baseline against which to examine the multi-task configurations. In addition, the objective sampling strategy (the manner in which tasks are presented over evolutionary time) is varied, and so data for treatments implementing uniform sampling, even sampling, or degrees of generational sampling are also presented. The Lexicase mechanism successfully integrates evolution of both turn-and-seek and cargo-carry with wall-cross, though there is a performance penalty compared to single task evolution. The size of the penalty depends on the similarity of the tasks. Complementary tasks (wallcross/turn-and-seek) show better performance than antagonistic tasks (wall-cross/cargo-carry). In complementary tasks performance is not affected by the sampling strategy. Where tasks are antagonistic, uniform and even sampling strategies yield significantly better performance than generational sampling. In all cases the generational sampling requires more evaluations and consequently more computational resources. The results indicate that Lexicase is a viable mechanism for multitask evolution of animat neurocontrollers, though the degree of interference between tasks is a key consideration. The results also support the conclusion that the naive, uniform random sampling strategy is the best choice when considering final task performance, simplicity of implementation, and computational efficiency. © 2022 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","2022","2023-07-06 10:30:24","2023-07-06 10:30:31","","","","4","28","","Artif.

What are the implications of this for understanding and developing artificial general intelligence? Leading theoretical models of brain function are beginning to shed light on these questions. While artificial agents have excelled within narrowly circumscribed and specialised domains, domain-general intelligence has remained an elusive goal in artificial intelligence research. By contrast, humans and nonhuman animals are characterised by a capacity for flexible behaviour and general intelligence. In this article I argue that computational models of mental phenomena in predictive processing theories of the brain are starting to reveal the mechanisms underpinning domain-general intelligence in biological agents, and can inform the understanding and development of artificial general intelligence. I focus particularly on approaches to computational phenomenology in the active inference framework. Specifically, I argue that computational mechanisms of affective feelings in active inference—affective self-modelling—are revealing of how biological agents are able to achieve flexible behavioural repertoires and general intelligence. I argue that (i) affective self-modelling functions to “tune” organisms to the most tractable goals in the environmental context; and (ii) affective and agentic self-modelling is central to the capacity to perform mental actions in goal-directed imagination and creative cognition. I use this account as a basis to argue that general intelligence of the level and kind found in biological agents will likely require machines to be implemented with analogues of affective self-modelling. © MIT Press Journals.

We describe a simple neural model, called IMPROBED, in which two neural programs construct an artificial brain that can simultaneously solve multiple computational problems. One program represents the neuron soma and the other the dendrite. The soma program decides whether neurons move, change, die, or replicate. The dendrite program decides whether dendrites extend, change, die, or replicate. Since developmental programs build networks that change over time, it is necessary to define new problem classes that are suitable to evaluate such approaches. We show that the pair of evolved programs can build a single network from which multiple conventional ANNs can be extracted, each of which can solve a different computational problem.

Here we assess whether access to social information leads to significant behavioral differences both when access to social information leads to improved performance on the task, and when it does not: Do any behaviors resulting from social information use, such as movement and increased agent interaction, persist even when the ability to discriminate between poisonous and non-poisonous food is no better than when social information is unavailable? Using a neuroevolutionary artificial life simulation, we show that social information use can lead to the emergence of behaviors that differ from when social information is unavailable, and that these behaviors act as a promoter of agent interaction. The results presented here suggest that the introduction of social information is sufficient, even when decoupled from within-lifetime learning, for the emergence of pro-social behaviors.

In the model, the fitness of a seed pattern is measured by one-on-one competitions in the Immigration Game, a two-player variation of the Game of Life. Our previous article showed that Model-S can serve as a highly abstract, simplified model of biological life: (1) The initial seed pattern is analogous to a genome. (2) The changes as the game runs are analogous to the development of the phenome. (3) Tournament selection in Model-S is analogous to natural selection in biology. (4) The Immigration Game in Model-S is analogous to competition in biology. (5) The first three layers in Model-S are analogous to biological reproduction. (6) The fusion of seed patterns in Model-S is analogous to symbiosis. The current article takes this analogy two steps further: (7) Autopoietic structures in the Game of Life (still lifes, oscillators, and spaceships—collectively known as ashes) are analogous to cells in biology. (8) The seed patterns in the Game of Life give rise to multiple, diverse, cooperating autopoietic structures, analogous to multicellular biological life. We use the apgsearch software (Ash Pattern Generator Search), developed by Adam Goucher for the study of ashes, to analyze autopoiesis and multicellularity in Model-S. We find that the fitness of evolved seed patterns in Model-S is highly correlated with the diversity and quantity of multicellular autopoietic structures. © 2021 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","2021","2023-07-06 10:30:24","2023-07-06 10:30:31","","26-43","","1","27","","Artif.

Each agent is provided a set of attendance predictors (or decision-making strategies) and uses the previous bar attendances to guess bar attendance for a given week to determine if the bar is worth attending. We previously showed how the distribution of used strategies among the population settles into an attractor by using a spatial phase space. However, this approach was limited as it required N − 1 dimensions to fully visualize the phase space of the problem, where N is the number of strategies available. Here we propose a new approach to phase space visualization and analysis by converting the strategy dynamics into a state transition network centered on strategy distributions. The resulting weighted, directed network gives a clearer representation of the strategy dynamics once we define an attractor of the strategy phase space as a sink-strongly connected component. This enables us to study the resulting network to draw conclusions about the performance of the different strategies. We find that this approach not only is applicable to the El Farol Bar problem, but also addresses the dimensionality issue and is theoretically applicable to a wide variety of discretized complex systems. © 2021 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","2021","2023-07-06 10:30:24","2023-07-06 10:30:32","","113-130","","2","27","","Artif.

In this context we are interested in falling paper systems, specifically the V-shaped falling paper ( VSFP) system that exhibits a set of discrete falling behaviors across the morphological parameter space. Our previous work has investigated how morphology influences dominant falling behaviors in the VSFP system. In this article we build on this analysis to investigate the nature of behavioral transitions in the same system. First, we investigate stochastic behavior transitions. We demonstrate how morphology influences the likelihood of different transitions, with certain morphologies leading to a wide range of possible paths through the behavior-space. Second, we investigate deterministic transitions. To investigate behaviors over longer time periods than available in falling experiments we introduce a new experimental platform. We demonstrate how we can induce behavior transitions by modulating the energy input to the system. Certain behavior transitions are found to be irreversible, exhibiting a form of hysteresis, while others are fully reversible. Certain morphologies are shown to behave like simplistic sequential logic circuits, indicating that the system has a form of memory encoded into the morphology–environment interactions. Investigating the limits of how morphology–environment interactions induce non-trivial behaviors is a key step for the design of embodied artificial life-forms. © 2021 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","2022","2023-07-06 10:30:24","2023-07-06 10:30:32","","204-219","","","27","","Artif.

We know, however, that—especially in the case of asylum migration—the migrant journey often is a hazardous, difficult process where migrants make decisions based on limited information and under severe material constraints. Here we investigate the dynamics of the migration journey itself using a spatially explicit, agent-based model. In particular we are interested in the effects of limited information and information exchange. We find that under limited information, migration routes generally become suboptimal, their stochasticity increases, and migrants arrive much less frequently at their preferred destination. Under specific circumstances, self-organised consensus routes emerge that are largely unpredictable. Limited information also strongly reduces the migrants’ ability to react to changes in circumstances. We conclude, first, that information and information exchange is likely to have considerable effects on all aspects of migration and should thus be included in future modelling efforts and, second, that there are many questions in theoretical migration research that are likely to profit from the use of agent-based modelling techniques. © 2022 Massachusetts Institute of Technology","2023","2023-07-06 10:30:24","2023-07-06 10:30:32","","3-20","","1","29","","Artif.
